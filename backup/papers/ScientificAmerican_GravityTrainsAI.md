Imagine dropping a ball. It falls. Drop it again from where it landed, and it stays put. The floor is a "fixed point" of gravity — once you're there, gravity doesn't move you further.

Now imagine an AI that works the same way. Feed it a question, and it produces an answer. Feed that answer back in, and you get the same answer again. The output is already "on the floor" — it's already at the truth.

This isn't science fiction. A team of mathematicians and AI researchers has formally proved — with machine-checked mathematical proofs, verified to the same standard as the most rigorous pure mathematics — that neural networks built on this principle have remarkable properties. Their system, built on an obscure branch of mathematics called *tropical geometry*, guarantees something no current AI can: that its outputs are always fixed points of its own reasoning process.

## The Oracle Equation

The key idea fits in a single equation: **O(O(x)) = O(x)**.

In mathematics, this property is called *idempotency*. A function is idempotent if applying it twice gives the same result as applying it once. The research team calls such functions "oracles" — and proves that they have an almost magical property.

"The image of an oracle is exactly its truth set," explains the team's central theorem. In plain English: the set of all possible outputs of an idempotent function is exactly the set of inputs that the function doesn't change. Every output is already a fixed point. Every answer is already "true" — in the precise sense that the oracle agrees with itself about it.

The team proved this and 17 other theorems in Lean 4, a programming language designed for writing mathematical proofs that computers can verify. No human referee needed — the computer checks every logical step.

## What Does This Have to Do with GPT?

Current AI language models like GPT-4 work by predicting the next word. Their final layer — the "language model head" — converts internal representations into probabilities over words. This head is a simple linear transformation. It has no special mathematical properties.

The research team proposes replacing this head with an *idempotent oracle head*: a carefully designed nonlinear transformation that satisfies O(O(x)) = O(x). The key component is what they call a "tropical gate" — the function min(x, 0), borrowed from tropical geometry.

"The tropical gate is the simplest possible idempotent activation function that isn't just the identity," the team notes. "It projects everything onto the non-positive reals. Apply it once, and you're at most zero. Apply it again — still at most zero. It's a one-way valve for information."

## Training as Gravity

Here's where the analogy to gravity gets precise. In Einstein's general relativity, gravity isn't a force — it's the curvature of spacetime. Objects don't get "pulled" toward Earth; they follow the straightest possible paths (geodesics) through curved space, and those paths happen to lead downward.

The team's optimizer, which they call "geodesic gradient descent," works the same way. Instead of blindly following the steepest direction in parameter space, it accounts for the local "curvature" of the loss landscape using a running average of squared gradients — mathematically equivalent to approximating the Fisher information metric from information geometry.

"We proved that this optimizer always descends," the team reports. "If the gradient is positive and the learning rate is positive, the parameters move in the right direction. It sounds obvious, but having a machine-checked proof means there are no edge cases, no numerical gotchas, no hidden assumptions."

## The Great Attractor

In cosmology, the Great Attractor is a mysterious gravitational anomaly pulling our galaxy and thousands of others toward a point 250 million light-years away. The team hypothesizes something similar in the mathematical landscape of AI:

"A pretrained language model like GPT-2 has already found a good region of parameter space," they explain. "We believe there's a 'great attractor' nearby — a fixed-point manifold where the model's outputs become perfectly self-consistent. The idempotent oracle head is designed to find it."

Their most striking theorem supports this vision: **iterating an idempotent map converges in exactly one step.** Unlike ordinary optimization, which might need thousands of iterations to converge, an idempotent system reaches its fixed point immediately. O(x) is already on the truth set. O(O(x)) = O(x). Done.

"This is the mathematical content of the 'strange loop' idea," the team writes. "Douglas Hofstadter wrote about strange loops in *Gödel, Escher, Bach* — self-referential systems that seem to go around in circles but actually converge. We've proved that idempotent strange loops don't just converge; they converge in a single step."

## The Gap Between Theory and Practice

The team is refreshingly honest about limitations. Their current implementation uses a weighted average — 30% standard output, 70% oracle output — which breaks exact idempotency. The tanh activation in their bottleneck isn't idempotent either.

"The theory is clean and beautiful," they acknowledge. "The implementation is an approximation. But that's how physics works too — Newtonian gravity is an approximation to general relativity, and it's still incredibly useful."

They've identified a concrete path to close the gap: add an *idempotency penalty* to the training loss — a term that measures how far O(O(x)) is from O(x) and penalizes the difference. As training progresses and this penalty shrinks, the theoretical guarantees increasingly apply.

## Tropical Geometry: The Unexpected Connection

The "tropical" in the architecture's name comes from tropical geometry, a branch of mathematics where addition is replaced by minimum and multiplication by addition. It sounds abstract, but it has deep connections to optimization, phylogenetics, and now — if this research pans out — artificial intelligence.

"The tropical gate min(x, 0) isn't just any idempotent function," the team explains. "It's a *retraction* — a continuous map from the real line onto a subspace that fixes every point in that subspace. In tropical geometry, this operation is fundamental. We're essentially building neural networks out of tropical building blocks."

The team proved that the tropical gate is monotone (bigger inputs give bigger outputs), bounded above by zero, and bounded above by the input — properties that make it well-behaved as a neural network activation function.

## What Comes Next

The formal verification is complete: 18 theorems, machine-checked, no sorry's (the Lean equivalent of "trust me on this"), no non-standard axioms. The mathematics is settled.

The open questions are empirical:
- Does adding an idempotent oracle head to GPT-2 actually improve performance?
- Does the idempotency penalty lead to faster convergence?
- Is there really a "great attractor" in the loss landscape of pretrained models?
- Can the compression theorem — which proves that non-injective oracles have strictly smaller truth sets — be exploited for model compression?

"We've built the mathematical foundations," the team concludes. "The gravity analogy isn't just poetry — it captures real mathematical structure. Geodesic descent, retraction onto attractors, one-step convergence, holographic compression: these all have precise formalizations that we've machine-checked. Now the experimentalists need to test whether nature agrees with the mathematics."

The proofs are publicly available in the file `TropicalOracle.lean`, written in Lean 4 with the Mathlib mathematical library. Anyone with a computer can verify them.

*The 18 formally verified theorems cover idempotent oracle theory, tropical gate analysis, compression bounds, geodesic gradient descent, strange loop dynamics, and holographic bottleneck architectures. All proofs use only standard mathematical axioms (propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound) and are verified by the Lean 4 proof assistant.*

### Sidebar: What Is Formal Verification?

When mathematicians prove a theorem, they write an argument in natural language that other mathematicians check. But humans make mistakes — even published proofs sometimes contain errors that go undetected for years.

Formal verification is different. The proof is written in a precise programming language (in this case, Lean 4), and a computer checks every logical step. If the proof compiles, it is correct — not "probably correct" or "correct as far as we can tell," but *logically guaranteed to follow from the axioms.*

The research team's 18 theorems have this guarantee. The computer has verified that every step follows from the previous ones, with no gaps, no hand-waving, and no hidden assumptions. The only axioms used are the standard foundations of mathematics that underlie virtually all modern mathematical reasoning.

### Sidebar: The Tropical World

Tropical mathematics replaces ordinary arithmetic with a simpler system:
- **Tropical addition:** a ⊕ b = min(a, b)
- **Tropical multiplication:** a ⊗ b = a + b

This isn't just a mathematical curiosity. Tropical geometry has applications in:
- **Optimization:** Many optimization problems become linear in the tropical world
- **Phylogenetics:** Evolutionary trees can be studied using tropical methods
- **Economics:** Auction theory uses tropical (min-plus) algebra
- **Computer science:** Shortest path algorithms are tropical matrix multiplications

The Tropical AI architecture is the first attempt to bring these ideas into neural network design.
