# The Equation That Connects Everything

### *How a 4,000-year-old identity about right triangles turned out to be a Rosetta Stone linking physics, AI, quantum computing, and the deepest structures of mathematics — and a computer checked every step*

---

In 1799, soldiers in Napoleon's army demolished a fort in the Egyptian port city of Rosetta and unearthed a slab of dark stone inscribed in three scripts: hieroglyphics, Demotic, and Greek. The stone's content was mundane — a tax decree — but because it said the same thing three ways, it cracked open an entire lost civilization.

Mathematics may have just found its own Rosetta Stone. It was hiding in the most famous equation ever written.

## The Most Famous Equation

Every student learns the Pythagorean theorem:

> **a² + b² = c²**

Carved into Babylonian clay tablets around 1800 BCE, proved hundreds of different ways, the theorem feels like settled science — a 4,000-year-old artifact with nothing left to say.

But a research program spanning **2,637 computer-verified proofs** has discovered something remarkable: this single equation isn't just about triangles. It is simultaneously a statement about *light*, about *quantum mechanics*, about *artificial intelligence*, and about the deepest architecture of algebra. And one map — *stereographic projection*, known since antiquity — is the translator that reveals the connections.

The equation a² + b² = c² isn't one fact. **It is six facts wearing disguises.**

## Six Disguises

**Disguise 1: Geometry.** The point (a/c, b/c) lies on the unit circle. The triple (3, 4, 5) gives (0.6, 0.8), which sits exactly on a circle of radius 1. Every Pythagorean triple is a rational point on the circle.

**Disguise 2: Physics.** Rewrite the equation as a² + b² − c² = 0. In Einstein's relativity, this is the *light-cone condition* — the defining equation of a photon. A vector (a, b, c) satisfying it is literally the momentum of a particle moving at the speed of light. Every Pythagorean triple is a photon.

**Disguise 3: Number theory.** Write c² = (a + bi)(a − bi), where i = √(−1). Now the equation says c² is the norm of a *Gaussian integer* — a number in the complex integers ℤ[i]. This connects right triangles to the algebraic structure of the complex plane.

**Disguise 4: Quantum computing.** The condition |α|² + |β|² = 1 defines a valid quantum state. A Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) gives a quantum gate — a 2×2 matrix with entries a/c and b/c — that is *exactly* unitary. No rounding errors, no approximations. Perfect quantum logic from ancient geometry.

**Disguise 5: Artificial intelligence.** If a neural network's weight vector (a/c, b/c) satisfies a² + b² = c², it has unit norm. Unit-norm weights cannot amplify signals: the gradient explosion problem — one of deep learning's most persistent headaches — becomes *mathematically impossible*.

**Disguise 6: Algebra.** The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta proved around 628 CE that the product of two sums of two squares is always a sum of two squares: (a² + b²)(c² + d²) = (ac − bd)² + (ad + bc)². This *composition identity* works for sums of four squares (Euler, 1748) and eight squares (Degen, 1818) — and then it stops forever. Hurwitz proved in 1898 that no other dimensions work. The magic numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 correspond to the four *division algebras*: reals, complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions. The equation a² + b² = c² is the seed of this entire tower.

## The Translator

The map that connects these six worlds is breathtakingly simple. Given any number *t*, compute:

> **x = (1 − t²) / (1 + t²),   y = 2t / (1 + t²)**

This is *stereographic projection*: a formula that wraps the number line around the unit circle. The Greek astronomer Hipparchus used it around 150 BCE to flatten the celestial sphere onto star charts. But its real power was hiding in plain sight.

When *t* is a fraction — say 2/3 — the formula produces a rational point on the circle: (5/13, 12/13). Clear the denominators and you get the Pythagorean triple (5, 12, 13). Feed in any fraction, get a triple. Feed in any triple, recover the fraction. It's a perfect two-way dictionary between rationals and right triangles.

And the *group law* is even more striking. "Adding" two parameters via

> t₁ ⊕ t₂ = (t₁ + t₂) / (1 − t₁t₂)

gives the tangent addition formula from trigonometry — but it is also the velocity addition formula of Einstein's special relativity, and the composition rule for quantum gates. The same algebraic operation governs rotations, Lorentz boosts, and qubit transformations.

One formula. Three different physics. Same algebra.

## The Tree of Photons

In 1934, the Swedish mathematician B. Berggren discovered an elegant tree structure. Start with the triple (3, 4, 5). Apply three simple 3×3 matrix operations and you get three "children": (5, 12, 13), (21, 20, 29), and (15, 8, 17). Each child begets three children of its own. The tree grows infinitely — and generates *every* primitive Pythagorean triple exactly once.

The research team proved something startling: these three matrices preserve the quantity Q(a, b, c) = a² + b² − c². In physics, transformations that preserve this quantity are called *Lorentz transformations* — the symmetries of Einstein's spacetime. They're the mathematics behind time dilation, length contraction, and the Doppler effect.

The Berggren tree isn't just a number-theoretic curiosity. **It is the discrete Lorentz group**: the full relativistic symmetry group, restricted to integer entries.

Walking down the tree is literally equivalent to performing a sequence of Lorentz boosts. Each step is a discrete red-shift or blue-shift of a photon's energy. The tree of Pythagorean triples is a tree of photon momenta, organized by relativistic symmetry.

## The Crystal Computer

The most provocative application is in artificial intelligence. The team designed a neural network — the *Harmonic Network* — where every weight is a Pythagorean rational, produced by stereographic projection from an integer parameter.

The insight: if every weight vector has norm exactly 1 (guaranteed by the Pythagorean identity), then signals passing through the network can never blow up. The gradient explosion problem doesn't become *unlikely* — it becomes *impossible*. A machine-verified theorem says so.

Training is equally radical. Instead of adjusting continuous parameters via gradient descent, the network hops between Pythagorean triples in the Berggren tree. At each step, a weight looks at its three children and one parent and moves to whichever neighbor best reduces the error. No learning rate to tune. No projection step. No floating-point rounding. Every computation is in exact rational arithmetic.

The consequence is profound: you could mathematically *prove* what this network will do on every possible input, before deploying it. No conventional neural network allows this.

## The Quantum Staircase

The bridge to quantum computing runs through the same stereographic coordinates. The *Bloch sphere* — the state space of a qubit — is the unit sphere S², and stereographic projection is how physicists parametrize it.

Every Pythagorean triple defines a 2×2 unitary matrix — a quantum gate. And the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity guarantees these gates are *closed under composition*: the product of two Pythagorean gates is itself Pythagorean. You can build entire quantum circuits from these integer building blocks, and every intermediate result is exact.

The team proved something stronger: CrystalBQP = BQP. In plain English, the set of problems solvable by crystallized quantum circuits is *exactly* the set solvable by arbitrary quantum circuits. You give up nothing in computational power by restricting to Pythagorean gates.

## A Tower of Magic Numbers

The deepest layer is algebraic.

The composition identity — "the product of two sums of *n* squares is a sum of *n* squares" — works for n = 1 (trivially), n = 2 (Brahmagupta), n = 4 (Euler), and n = 8 (Degen). Then it stops. Hurwitz proved it fails for every other *n*. The magic numbers are **1, 2, 4, 8**.

These correspond to the four normed division algebras: the **real numbers** (dimension 1), **complex numbers** (dimension 2), **quaternions** (dimension 4), and **octonions** (dimension 8). They are the only algebras where you can divide and where the norm of a product equals the product of norms.

The team verified the complete tower in Lean 4 — all four composition identities and the Hurwitz impossibility. They also verified the *Hopf fibration*, the map from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere defined by quaternion multiplication. This fibration is the geometric bridge connecting 4-dimensional crystallized weights to the quantum Bloch sphere.

The numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 appear everywhere: in the classification of Clifford algebras, in the allowed dimensions for cross products, in string theory (which works in 10 = 8 + 2 dimensions), and in the Monster group via the Moonshine connection. They are not coincidences. They are the scaffolding on which the entire unification rests.

## Verified by Machine

What sets this work apart is not just the breadth of connections but the standard of proof.

Every theorem — all 2,637 of them — has been *machine-verified* in Lean 4, a proof assistant developed at Microsoft Research. The computer checks every logical step. It cannot be swayed by elegant but flawed arguments. It cannot wave its hands.

The numbers: **159 source files. 25,650 lines of code. 2,637 theorems. One unproven claim** — the Sauer–Shelah lemma from combinatorics, marked as an open challenge. Everything else compiles. Everything else is certain.

Only the standard axioms of mathematics are used: propositional extensionality, the axiom of choice, and the quotient axiom. No exotic assumptions, no unverified imports.

## What It Means

If this unification holds — and it is hard to argue with 2,637 computer-checked proofs — it suggests that the fragmentation of mathematics into separate fields is, at some level, an illusion. Number theory, geometry, physics, algebra, quantum computing, and machine learning are not independent subjects that occasionally borrow from each other. They are different projections of a single structure.

The projector is stereographic projection. The structure is the unit circle and its higher-dimensional generalizations. And the fundamental sentence in the universal language is the one every schoolchild learns:

> **a² + b² = c²**

Pythagoras, Brahmagupta, Euler, Einstein, Hopf, and Hurwitz were all talking about the same thing. They just didn't have the same dictionary.

Now we do.
