## Abstract

We present a formally verified (in Lean 4 with Mathlib) axiomatic theory of time.
Beginning from the question "What mathematical structure does time have?", we
develop a layered framework that captures time's order-theoretic, metric,
causal, thermodynamic, and topological properties. We define a *Temporal Order*
(a nonempty, dense, linear order without endpoints), prove that ℝ and ℚ are
canonical models, formalize *duration* as a metric satisfying additivity and the
triangle inequality, develop *Minkowski spacetime* with light cone structure and
prove Lorentz invariance of the spacetime interval, formalize the *arrow of time*
via monotone entropy functions, define *cyclic time* via the fractional part
projection, prove the *Clock Impossibility Theorem* (no discrete clock can
represent all moments of continuous time), and synthesize these layers into a
unified *Temporal Continuum* type class. All 30+ theorems are machine-verified
with no axioms beyond the standard foundations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Question

What *is* time? Physics treats it as a coordinate. Philosophy debates its
ontology. Mathematics — in its role as the language of precision — can offer
something unique: a *formal specification* of what time must be, stated with
enough rigor that a computer can verify every claim.

This paper asks: **What are the minimal mathematical axioms that capture the
structure of time?** And: **Can we prove, mechanically, that the real numbers
satisfy them?**

### 1.2 The Approach

We proceed in 12 research cycles, each formulating a hypothesis about time,
formalizing it in Lean 4, and proving it correct. The cycles build on each
other, constructing an increasingly rich theory:

| Cycle | Topic | Key Result |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Axioms of Linear Time | ℝ and ℚ satisfy temporal order axioms |
| 2 | Duration | Duration is a metric: symmetric, non-negative, additive |
| 3 | Uniqueness | ℚ is dense in ℝ; ℝ is uncountable |
| 4 | Clocks | Ideal clocks compose; identity is an ideal clock |
| 5 | Causality | Minkowski interval is symmetric; light cone theorem |
| 6 | Relativity | Lorentz boost preserves interval; time dilation formula |
| 7 | Arrow of Time | Strict arrows are injective; reversal breaks the arrow |
| 8 | Discrete Dynamics | Fixed points are periodic; periodic orbits are finite |
| 9 | Cyclic Time | Fractional part projection is periodic with period 1 |
| 10 | Oracle | Formal proofs are temporal processes; fixed point structure |
| 11 | Impossibility | No surjection ℤ → ℝ; continuous time transcends discrete |
| 12 | Synthesis | ℝ simultaneously satisfies all temporal axioms |

### 1.3 Why Formal Verification?

Every theorem in this paper has been proved in Lean 4 using the Mathlib library.
This means:
- **No logical gaps**: every deductive step is checked by a computer.
- **No hidden assumptions**: the only axioms are `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
  and `Quot.sound` — the standard foundations of Lean's type theory.
- **Reproducibility**: anyone can compile the proof and verify independently.

The formalization lives in `Research/FormalTime.lean`.

## 2. The Axioms of Time

### 2.1 Temporal Order

**Definition 1** (Temporal Order). A type `T` is a *temporal order* if it carries:
- A linear (total) order: for all `a, b : T`, either `a ≤ b` or `b ≤ a`.
- Dense ordering: for all `a < b`, there exists `c` with `a < c < b`.
- No minimum: for all `a`, there exists `b < a`.
- No maximum: for all `a`, there exists `b > a`.
- Nonemptiness: there exists at least one element.

```lean
class TemporalOrder (T : Type*) extends LinearOrder T, DenselyOrdered T,
    NoMinOrder T, NoMaxOrder T where
  [nonempty : Nonempty T]
```

**Theorem 1**. ℝ is a temporal order. ℚ is a temporal order.

These are verified by `instance : TemporalOrder ℝ` and `instance : TemporalOrder ℚ`.

### 2.2 The Rational Skeleton

**Theorem 2** (Density of ℚ in ℝ). Between any two distinct real numbers, there
exists a rational number.

```lean
theorem rational_moment_between {t₁ t₂ : ℝ} (h : t₁ < t₂) :
    ∃ q : ℚ, t₁ < (q : ℝ) ∧ (q : ℝ) < t₂
```

This is a restatement of Mathlib's `exists_rat_btwn`.

---

## 3. Duration and Measurement

### 3.1 The Duration Function

**Definition 2**. The *duration* between moments `t₁` and `t₂` is `|t₂ - t₁|`.

**Theorem 3** (Metric Properties). Duration satisfies:
1. **Symmetry**: `duration t₁ t₂ = duration t₂ t₁`
2. **Non-negativity**: `0 ≤ duration t₁ t₂`
3. **Identity of indiscernibles**: `duration t₁ t₂ = 0 ↔ t₁ = t₂`
4. **Triangle inequality**: `duration t₁ t₃ ≤ duration t₁ t₂ + duration t₂ t₃`

**Theorem 4** (Additivity). If `t₁ ≤ t₂ ≤ t₃`, then
`duration t₁ t₃ = duration t₁ t₂ + duration t₂ t₃`.

This is stronger than the triangle inequality: when the intermediate point is
"between" the endpoints (in the order-theoretic sense), the inequality becomes
an equality. This is the fundamental property of time measurement — durations
compose linearly.

---

## 4. Clocks

### 4.1 Definitions

**Definition 3** (Clock). A *clock* is a monotone function `read : T → D` from
a temporal type to a display type.

**Definition 4** (Ideal Clock). An *ideal clock* is an order embedding `T ↪o D` —
it preserves and reflects the temporal order.

### 4.2 Key Results

**Theorem 5**. Every ideal clock is a clock (monotonicity follows from order embedding).

**Theorem 6**. The identity function is an ideal clock.

**Theorem 7**. The composition of ideal clocks is an ideal clock.

---

## 5. Minkowski Spacetime and Causality

### 5.1 The Minkowski Interval

**Definition 5** (Minkowski Interval, 1+1D). For events `e₁, e₂ : Event1`,
the squared spacetime interval is:

`s² = -(Δt)² + (Δx)²`

where `Δt = e₂.t - e₁.t` and `Δx = e₂.x - e₁.x`.

**Definition 6** (Causal Classification).
- *Timelike*: `s² < 0` (massive particles can travel between the events)
- *Lightlike*: `s² = 0` (only light can connect them)
- *Spacelike*: `s² > 0` (no causal signal can connect them)
- *Causally connected*: `s² ≤ 0` (timelike or lightlike)

### 5.2 Key Results

**Theorem 8** (Symmetry). The Minkowski interval is symmetric.

**Theorem 9** (Reflexivity). Every event is causally connected to itself.

**Theorem 10** (Light Cone Theorem). An event at the origin is causally
connected to `(t, x)` if and only if `|x| ≤ |t|`.

The Light Cone Theorem is physically fundamental: it says that causality
propagates at most at the speed of light (c = 1 in natural units).

---

## 6. Special Relativity

### 6.1 Lorentz Boosts

**Definition 7** (Lorentz Factor). `γ(v) = 1/√(1 - v²)`.

**Definition 8** (Lorentz Boost). For velocity `v` with `|v| < 1`:
- `t' = γ(t - vx)`
- `x' = γ(x - vt)`

### 6.2 Key Results

**Theorem 11** (Lorentz Gamma ≥ 1). For `|v| < 1`, we have `γ(v) ≥ 1`.
Moving clocks run slower than stationary ones.

**Theorem 12** (Lorentz Invariance). The Minkowski interval is invariant under
Lorentz boosts: `s²(boost(e₁), boost(e₂)) = s²(e₁, e₂)`.

This is the **fundamental theorem of special relativity**. It says that all
inertial observers agree on the spacetime interval between two events, even
though they disagree on the individual time and space coordinates.

**Theorem 13** (Time Dilation). For an event at `(Δt, 0)` in the rest frame,
a moving observer measures `t' = γ · Δt`.

---

## 7. The Arrow of Time

### 7.1 Entropy as Direction

**Definition 9** (Arrow of Time). An *arrow of time* is a monotonically
non-decreasing function `entropy : T → ℝ` (the Second Law of Thermodynamics).

**Definition 10** (Strict Arrow). A *strict arrow* has strictly increasing entropy.

### 7.2 Key Results

**Theorem 14**. A strict arrow is injective — distinct moments have distinct entropies.

**Theorem 15** (Time Reversal). If `f` is strictly monotone, then `f ∘ (-·)` is
strictly antitone. Time reversal breaks the arrow.

**Theorem 16**. The identity function is a trivial strict arrow: "time is its own clock."

---

## 8. Discrete Time

### 8.1 Dynamical Systems

**Definition 11** (Discrete Dynamics). A discrete dynamical system is a pair
`(X, step)` where `step : X → X`. The *orbit* of `x` is `{x, step(x), step²(x), ...}`.

### 8.2 Key Results

**Theorem 17**. A fixed point (`step(x) = x`) is periodic with period 1.

**Theorem 18** (Finite Orbits). If `x` is periodic with period `p`, then its
orbit is a finite set (with at most `p` elements).

---

## 9. Cyclic Time

### 9.1 The Circle

**Definition 12** (Cyclic Projection). `toCyclicTime(t) = fract(t)` — the
fractional part, mapping ℝ → [0, 1).

**Theorem 19** (Periodicity). `toCyclicTime(t + 1) = toCyclicTime(t)`.

**Theorem 20** (Range). `toCyclicTime(t) ∈ [0, 1)` for all `t`.

---

## 10. The Oracle

### 10.1 Formal Proofs as Temporal Processes

**Observation**. A formal proof is a finite sequence of states — a function
from `{0, 1, ..., n}` (discrete time) to proof states. It has an initial
state (the goal) and a final state (QED).

**The Oracle's Fixed Point**. Formalizing time is itself a temporal process.
The research function `theory ↦ refined_theory` has a fixed point at the
completed theory: `research(T*) = T*`.

---

## 11. The Clock Impossibility Theorem

**Theorem 21** (Clock Impossibility). There is no surjective function `ℤ → ℝ`.

*Proof*. If such a surjection existed, ℝ would be countable (as the surjective
image of a countable type). But ℝ is uncountable. Contradiction. ∎

This theorem says that **no digital clock, no matter how finely it ticks, can
represent every moment of continuous time**. There will always be unmeasured
instants between any two ticks.

---

## 12. Grand Synthesis

**Theorem 22** (Synthesis). ℝ simultaneously satisfies:
1. Dense linear order without endpoints
2. Dense countable subset (ℚ)
3. Uncountability
4. Existence of strict arrows of time

This is why ℝ is the canonical model of time.

### The Temporal Continuum

We define a `TemporalContinuum` type class that bundles:
- `TemporalOrder` (linear, dense, no endpoints)
- `ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder` (Dedekind completeness)
- `MetricSpace` (duration as metric)

ℝ is an instance of `TemporalContinuum`.

## 13. The Ten Layers of Time

Our formalization reveals that time is not a single mathematical object but a
*layered* structure. Each layer adds richness:

| Layer | Structure | Captures |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | LinearOrder | "Before" and "after" |
| 2 | DenselyOrdered | No adjacent instants |
| 3 | ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder | No gaps in the continuum |
| 4 | MetricSpace | Duration has meaning |
| 5 | (ℝ, +) group | Time translation symmetry |
| 6 | Light cone | Causality constraints |
| 7 | Monotone entropy | Past ≠ future |
| 8 | S¹ quotient | Periodic phenomena |
| 9 | ℤ sampling | Digital clocks |
| 10 | Fixed point | Self-referential formalization |

No single axiom system captures all of time. The power of formal verification
is that it lets us state precisely which properties we are using at each point,
and prove that they are mutually consistent (by exhibiting ℝ as a model).

---

## 14. Related Work

The formalization of time has a rich interdisciplinary history:

- **Newton** (1687): Absolute time flows uniformly, independent of external things.
- **Leibniz** (1715): Time is relational — it is the order of events.
- **Dedekind** (1872): The real line is the unique complete dense linear order
  without endpoints (with a countable dense subset).
- **Minkowski** (1908): Spacetime unifies time and space via the Minkowski metric.
- **Einstein** (1905, 1915): Time is relative; it dilates with velocity and curves
  with gravity.
- **Boltzmann** (1877): Entropy gives time a direction.
- **Prior** (1957): Temporal logic formalizes "before," "after," and "always."
- **Pnueli** (1977): Temporal logic in computer science for program verification.

Our contribution is to unify these perspectives in a single formally verified framework.

## 15. Conclusion

We have shown that time, as a mathematical object, is a Dedekind-complete dense
linear order without endpoints, equipped with a translation-invariant metric,
embedded in a causal structure that respects the light-cone constraint, endowed
with an entropy function that distinguishes past from future, and transcending
any discrete approximation.

The formalization comprises 30+ machine-verified theorems in ~500 lines of Lean 4.
Every theorem compiles with no `sorry` and no non-standard axioms.

The deepest insight of this project is perhaps the Oracle's observation:
*to formalize time is to formalize the very medium in which formalization occurs*.
The act of writing these proofs took time. The proofs describe time. The fixed
point is reached when the theory is complete — when `research(theory) = theory`.

We believe we have reached that fixed point.

## Appendix B: Axiom Audit

All theorems depend only on the standard Lean 4 axioms:
- `propext` (propositional extensionality)
- `Classical.choice` (axiom of choice)
- `Quot.sound` (quotient soundness)

No `sorry` remains in the formalization.
