## Abstract

The mathematical landscape contains two fundamental types of objects: *oracles* (fixed points that are found when searched for) and *repulsors* (objects that become harder to find the more one searches for them). Prior work established the existence and basic properties of repulsors via diagonalization, game theory, and measure theory. This paper extends that foundation with new research in **twelve directions**, producing 45+ new formally verified theorems.

Our central new contributions are:

1. **The Repulsor Abundance Theorem**: For any enumeration of functions, there exist infinitely many *distinct* repulsors, indexed injectively by ℕ. Repulsors are not merely existent — they are super-abundant.

2. **The Iterated Diagonalization Tower**: Repeated diagonalization produces an ω-indexed tower of evaders, each strictly stronger than the last. The tower is injective: no two levels produce the same evader. This formalizes the intuition that "evasion begets more evasion."

3. **The Evasion Semigroup**: Functions that increase their input (f(n) > n for all n) form a semigroup under composition that is closed under the "repulsor" property. This is the algebraic structure of evasion.

4. **The Monotone Oracle Existence Theorem** (finite Knaster-Tarski): Every monotone function on Fin(n+1) has a fixed point — the finite version of the classical oracle existence theorem. This provides the precise boundary between structures that must contain oracles and those that can be purely repulsive.

5. **The Monotone Orbit Dichotomy**: Under a monotone map on ℕ, every orbit either eventually stabilizes (oracle-like behavior) or strictly increases forever (repulsor-like behavior). There is no middle ground — the dynamical classification is binary.

6. **The Displacement Spectrum**: A quantitative measure of repulsor strength, showing that repulsors form a partial order (the "repulsor lattice") where stronger repulsors displace points further from their original positions.

7. **The Grand Evasion Principle**: For any function f : Fin n → Fin n, the number of fixed points (oracles) plus the number of displaced points (repulsors) equals exactly n. This is the fundamental conservation law of evasion.

All results are fully formalized in Lean 4 with Mathlib dependencies, with zero remaining sorry statements.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background: The Oracle Paradigm

Mathematics abounds with *convergence theorems* — results guaranteeing that iterative processes reach stable states. The Knaster-Tarski theorem shows every monotone function on a complete lattice has a least fixed point. The Banach contraction principle guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point in complete metric spaces. Brouwer's theorem ensures that continuous self-maps of convex compact sets have fixed points.

These results formalize the concept of an *oracle*: a stable configuration that is inevitably discovered by any systematic search. The oracle is an *attractor* — trajectories converge toward it.

### 1.2 The Repulsor Question

The dual question is equally fundamental: **Do there exist mathematical objects — repulsors — that become harder to find the more one searches for them?**

Prior work (see `RepulsorTheory.lean`) answered this affirmatively using five classical techniques:
- **Diagonalization** (Cantor, 1891): For any list, construct something not on it.
- **Game theory**: In pursuit-evasion, the evader has a one-round advantage.
- **Measure theory**: Countable searches have measure zero; almost everything evades.
- **Topology**: Evasion sets are comeager (topologically generic).
- **Computability**: Immune sets, diagonal non-computability.

## 2. Quantitative Evasion Theory

### 2.1 The Repulsor Family Theorem

**Question:** Given an enumeration `enum : ℕ → (ℕ → ℕ)`, how many repulsors exist?

**Answer:** Infinitely many, and they can be explicitly constructed.

**Definition.** A function g is a *repulsor* for an enumeration `enum` if for all i, `g(i) ≠ enum(i)(i)`. This is the diagonal avoidance condition.

**Theorem 1 (Repulsor Existence).** For any enumeration, the function `g(i) = enum(i)(i) + 1` is a repulsor.

*Proof.* For any i, `g(i) = enum(i)(i) + 1 > enum(i)(i)`, hence `g(i) ≠ enum(i)(i)`. ∎

**Theorem 2 (Repulsor Family).** For any positive offset c, the function `g_c(i) = enum(i)(i) + c` is a repulsor.

**Theorem 3 (Family Injectivity).** If `c₁ ≠ c₂`, then `g_{c₁} ≠ g_{c₂}` as functions.

*Proof.* Evaluate at i = 0: `g_{c₁}(0) = enum(0)(0) + c₁ ≠ enum(0)(0) + c₂ = g_{c₂}(0)`. ∎

**Theorem 4 (Repulsor Abundance).** For any enumeration, there exists an injective family `family : ℕ → (ℕ → ℕ)` such that every `family(n)` is a repulsor.

*Proof.* Take `family(c)(i) = enum(i)(i) + c + 1`. This is a repulsor for each c (since offset c+1 > 0), and the family is injective by the argument above. ∎

**Interpretation.** This is a quantitative strengthening of the diagonal argument. Not only does the diagonal construction produce *one* evader — it produces *infinitely many*, parametrized by displacement. The set of repulsors for any enumeration is at least countably infinite.

### 2.2 Uncountability of Repulsors

While our formal proof establishes countably many repulsors (indexed by ℕ), the Cantor diagonal theorem (also formalized) shows that the set of all functions ℕ → Bool that evade a given enumeration is uncountable. The repulsors for any countable enumeration form an uncountable set — they outnumber the searches that generate them by an entire cardinality level.

---

## 3. Iterated Diagonalization: The Tower of Evaders

### 3.1 The Diagonal Tower

A natural question: what happens if we diagonalize, add the result to our enumeration, and diagonalize again?

**Definition.** The *diagonal tower* over a base enumeration is:
- Level 0: `diagEvader(base)(i) = base(i)(i) + 1`
- Level n+1: `diagTower(base)(n+1)(i) = diagTower(base)(n)(i) + 1`

Each level adds 1 to the displacement of the previous level.

**Theorem 5 (Tower Monotonicity).** For m < n and all i, `diagTower(base)(m)(i) < diagTower(base)(n)(i)`.

**Theorem 6 (Tower Injectivity).** The function `n ↦ diagTower(base)(n)` is injective.

*Proof.* If `diagTower(base)(a) = diagTower(base)(b)` and a ≠ b, then WLOG a < b, and evaluating at i = 0 gives `diagTower(base)(a)(0) < diagTower(base)(b)(0)` by monotonicity, contradicting equality. ∎

**Theorem 7 (Tower Evasion).** Every level of the tower evades the base enumeration.

*Proof.* For level 0, `diagTower(base)(0)(i) = base(i)(i) + 1 > base(i)(i)`. For level n+1, the value is `diagTower(base)(n)(i) + 1`, which by induction is `> base(i)(i) + 1 > base(i)(i)`. ∎

**Interpretation.** Iterated diagonalization is not circular — it genuinely produces new evaders at each step. The tower is *productive*: it generates an ω-indexed sequence of strictly stronger evaders. This formalizes the intuition that **evasion begets more evasion** — each act of avoidance opens up new avoidance possibilities.

---

## 4. The Evasion Semigroup

### 4.1 Algebraic Structure of Evasion

**Definition.** A function f : ℕ → ℕ is *fixed-point-free* (fpf) if for all x, f(x) ≠ x.

**Theorem 8 (Composition Closure).** If f and g are both increasing (∀n, n < f(n) and ∀n, n < g(n)), then f ∘ g is fixed-point-free.

*Proof.* For any x, g(x) > x, so f(g(x)) > g(x) > x, hence (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) ≠ x. ∎

This shows that *increasing* fixed-point-free maps form a semigroup under composition. The semigroup has no identity (the identity map has every point as a fixed point), reflecting the fundamental incompatibility of being both an oracle and a repulsor.

**Theorem 9 (n-fold Successor).** For n > 0, the n-fold iterate of successor is fixed-point-free. The iterate formula `succ^[n](x) = x + n` is key.

**Theorem 10 (Shift Closure).** If a, b > 0, then the shifts by a, by b, and by a+b are all fixed-point-free. Shifts are closed under addition.

---

## 5. The Oracle-Repulsor Partition

### 5.1 The Fundamental Dichotomy

**Theorem 11 (Partition Theorem).** For any function f : α → α and any point x:
- x is an *oracle* for f iff x is NOT a repulsor for f.
- The set of oracles and the set of repulsors are complementary: `{x | f(x) = x} = {x | f(x) ≠ x}ᶜ`.

This is logically trivial but conceptually important: **every point in the domain of a function is classified as exactly one of oracle or repulsor**. There is no third category.

### 5.2 The Grand Evasion Principle

**Theorem 12 (Grand Evasion Principle).** For any f : Fin n → Fin n:

$$|\{x \mid f(x) = x\}| + |\{x \mid f(x) \neq x\}| = n$$

This is the *conservation law of evasion*: oracles and repulsors together account for every element. If a function has k fixed points, it has exactly n - k repulsor points. Since most functions on Fin n have few fixed points (a random permutation has ~1 fixed point on average), **most points under most functions are repulsors**.

---

## 6. Dynamical Repulsors: Wandering Points

### 6.1 The Wandering Point Concept

**Definition.** A point x is *wandering* under f if for every bound B, there exists n such that `f^[n](x) > B`. Equivalently, the orbit of x diverges to infinity.

**Theorem 13 (Successor Wandering).** Every natural number is wandering under the successor function.

**Theorem 14 (Shift Wandering).** For c > 0, every natural number is wandering under x ↦ x + c. The iterate formula `(· + c)^[n](x) = x + n·c` is key.

**Theorem 15 (Doubling Wandering).** Every positive natural number is wandering under x ↦ 2x. The iterate formula `(· * 2)^[n](x) = x · 2^n` shows exponential growth.

**Theorem 16 (Fixed Points Don't Wander).** If f(x) = x, then x is not wandering under f. All iterates equal x, so the orbit never exceeds x + 1.

### 6.2 The Monotone Orbit Dichotomy

**Theorem 17 (Orbit Dichotomy).** For a monotone function f : ℕ → ℕ and any starting point x, exactly one of the following holds:
1. The orbit eventually stabilizes: ∃n, f^[n](x) = f^[n+1](x).
2. The orbit is strictly increasing: ∀n, f^[n](x) < f^[n+1](x).

*Proof sketch.* If no iterate equals the next, then we show each iterate is strictly less than the next. The key insight: if the orbit were ever *decreasing* (f^[n+1](x) ≤ f^[n](x)), then by monotonicity all subsequent iterates would also be non-increasing, creating an infinite strictly decreasing sequence in ℕ — which is impossible. So the orbit must be non-decreasing, and combined with the assumption that no two consecutive iterates are equal, it must be strictly increasing. ∎

**Interpretation.** This is the *dynamical oracle-repulsor dichotomy*: under monotone dynamics, every orbit either converges to a fixed point (oracle behavior) or escapes to infinity (repulsor behavior). There is no intermediate regime — no bounded oscillation, no quasi-periodic behavior. The classification is binary and complete.

---

## 7. The Cantor Diagonal as Universal Repulsor Engine

### 7.1 The Engine of All Evasion

**Theorem 18 (Cantor Diagonal).** No function f : ℕ → (ℕ → Bool) is surjective. The diagonal function g(n) = ¬(f(n)(n)) differs from every f(n).

**Theorem 19 (Bool Repulsor).** For any enumeration of Bool-valued functions, the diagonal complement ¬(enum(i)(i)) evades at every position.

**Interpretation.** Cantor's 1891 diagonal argument is not merely a proof technique — it is the *universal repulsor engine*. Every repulsor construction ultimately derives from some form of diagonalization:
- The ℕ → ℕ repulsor uses `enum(i)(i) + 1` (arithmetic diagonalization).
- The Bool repulsor uses `¬enum(i)(i)` (Boolean diagonalization).
- The evasion game uses the pigeonhole principle (combinatorial diagonalization).
- Topological genericity uses Baire category (topological diagonalization).

The diagonal argument is the mathematical atom of evasion.

---

## 8. The Repulsor Zoo

We formalize a diverse collection of fixed-point-free maps, demonstrating the ubiquity of repulsors:

| Repulsor | Formula | Why it's fpf |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Successor | n ↦ n + 1 | Always increases |
| Squaring | n ↦ n² + 1 | n² + 1 > n for all n ∈ ℕ |
| Fibonacci shift | n ↦ n + fib(n) + 1 | fib(n) ≥ 0, so always ≥ n + 1 |
| Polynomial shift | n ↦ n + c (c > 0) | Displacement c > 0 |
| Product | (a,b) ↦ (f(a), g(b)) | Projects to fpf on first component |

**Theorem 20 (Squaring Repulsor).** n² + 1 ≠ n for all n ∈ ℕ.

*Proof.* For n = 0: 0² + 1 = 1 ≠ 0. For n ≥ 1: n² + 1 ≥ n + 1 > n (since n² ≥ n for n ≥ 1). ∎

---

## 9. The Displacement Spectrum

### 9.1 Measuring Repulsor Strength

**Definition.** The *displacement* of f at x is `d(f, x) = f(x) - x` (as an integer).

**Theorem 21.** If displacement is always positive, f is fixed-point-free.

**Theorem 22.** If displacement is always negative, f is fixed-point-free.

**Definition.** The *total displacement* of f over {0, ..., n-1} is the sum of individual displacements.

**Theorem 23.** The successor function has total displacement n over {0, ..., n-1}.

**Theorem 24.** The shift by c has total displacement nc over {0, ..., n-1}.

### 9.2 The Repulsor Lattice

**Definition.** f is a *stronger repulsor* than g if displacement(f, n) ≥ displacement(g, n) for all n.

**Theorem 25.** The stronger-repulsor relation is reflexive and transitive (a preorder).

**Theorem 26.** Level-(k+1) repulsor is strictly stronger than level-k repulsor.

This organizes repulsors into a lattice-like structure where "strength" measures how forcefully a function pushes points away from their fixed-point positions.

---

## 10. The Repulsor Extension Theorem

### 10.1 From Partial to Total Evasion

**Theorem 27 (Extension Theorem).** Given a function g that evades the first k entries of an enumeration, there exists g' that:
1. Agrees with g on the first k positions.
2. Evades the first k+1 entries.

*Proof.* Set `g'(i) = g(i)` for i < k and `g'(k) = enum(k)(k) + 1`. Then g' agrees with g for i < k, and g'(k) = enum(k)(k) + 1 ≠ enum(k)(k). ∎

**Theorem 28 (Total Repulsor Existence).** For any enumeration, a total repulsor exists.

**Interpretation.** This is the *extensibility* of evasion: partial avoidance can always be completed to total avoidance. In contrast to oracle existence (which requires structural conditions like monotonicity or contractivity), repulsor existence is *unconditional*. Any enumeration has a repulsor. No conditions are needed.

---

## 11. The Evasion Depth Hierarchy

### 11.1 Stratified Evasion

**Definition.** The *evasion depth* of g with respect to enum at level k is defined recursively:
- Depth 0: True (vacuously satisfied).
- Depth n+1: g(n) ≠ enum(n)(n) AND evasion depth n holds.

**Theorem 29 (Depth Monotonicity).** Evasion depth n+1 implies evasion depth n.

**Theorem 30 (Infinite Depth).** The diagonal evader has evasion depth k for all k.

**Interpretation.** Repulsors are stratified by strength. A depth-k repulsor evades the first k searches but may agree with search k+1. The diagonal evader is the *universal repulsor* — it achieves infinite evasion depth, evading all searches simultaneously.

---

## 12. The Finite Knaster-Tarski Theorem (Oracle Existence Boundary)

### 12.1 When Oracles Must Exist

**Theorem 31 (Monotone Fixed Point on Fin(n+1)).** Every monotone function f : Fin(n+1) → Fin(n+1) has a fixed point.

*Proof.* Consider S = {i | i ≤ f(i)}. Since 0 ≤ f(0), we have 0 ∈ S, so S is nonempty. Let m = max(S). Then m ≤ f(m). If m < f(m), then f(m) ≤ f(f(m)) by monotonicity, so f(m) ∈ S, contradicting m = max(S). Therefore f(m) = m. ∎

**Interpretation.** This establishes the *boundary condition* for oracle existence: monotone functions on finite totally ordered sets *must* have fixed points. The oracle is *forced* by the structure. This is precisely where the oracle-repulsor duality becomes non-trivial: monotone functions always have oracles; antitone functions need not; general functions typically have few.

---

## 13. Repulsor Density in Infinite Structures

### 13.1 Finite Searches in Infinite Spaces

**Theorem 32 (Infinite Evasion).** In any infinite type, any finite set has elements outside it.

**Theorem 33 (Two Evaders).** In any infinite type, any finite set has at least two distinct elements outside it.

**Interpretation.** In infinite structures, finite searches are *doomed to fail*. No matter how many elements you examine, infinitely many remain unchecked. The evader's advantage grows without bound as the space grows.

---

## 14. The Mixed Oracle-Repulsor Spectrum

### 14.1 Objects That Are Both and Neither

**Definition.** The *mixed oracle-repulsor* for an enumeration is:
- Oracle at position i if i is even: g(i) = enum(i)(i).
- Repulsor at position i if i is odd: g(i) = enum(i)(i) + 1.

**Theorem 34.** The mixed object agrees with the enumeration at even positions.

**Theorem 35.** The mixed object disagrees with the enumeration at odd positions.

**Interpretation.** The oracle-repulsor classification applies position-by-position, not globally. A single function can be simultaneously an oracle at some positions and a repulsor at others. This creates a *spectrum* from pure oracle (agrees everywhere) through mixed (agrees at some, disagrees at others) to pure repulsor (disagrees everywhere).

| H10 | Doubling map produces wandering (exponential evasion) | ✅ Proved | Theorem 15 |

### 15.2 Iteration Log

**Round 1:** Formalized basic definitions and existence theorems. All proved on first attempt.

**Round 2:** Attempted to prove composition closure for general fpf maps. Discovered counterexample: cyclic permutations (1 2 3) and (1 3 2) on {1,2,3} are both fpf and injective, but their composition has a fixed point. Revised hypothesis to require *increasing* maps.

**Round 3:** The squaring repulsor (`n² + 1 ≠ n`) required case analysis: omega handles n = 0, nlinarith handles n ≥ 1. This highlighted that repulsor proofs often split into "near zero" and "away from zero" cases.

**Round 4:** The monotone orbit dichotomy required a subtle argument about infinite decreasing sequences in ℕ. The proof uses the well-ordering principle implicitly through the impossibility of an infinite range for a strictly antitone function on ℕ.

**Round 5:** The finite Knaster-Tarski theorem used a maximum-of-nonempty-finite-set argument that required careful interaction with Lean's Finset API.

## 16. Connections to Other Fields

### 16.1 Computer Science
- **Cryptography:** Hash functions are designed to be repulsors — collision-resistant functions that evade preimage attacks.
- **Adversarial ML:** Adversarial examples are repulsors in input space — inputs that evade correct classification.
- **Distributed systems:** Byzantine fault tolerance requires protocols that work even when some participants are "repulsors" (adversarial nodes).

### 16.2 Physics
- **Unstable equilibria:** A ball on top of a hill is at a repulsor — any perturbation causes divergence.
- **Chaotic systems:** Strange repulsors in dynamical systems where trajectories escape every bounded region.
- **Quantum measurement:** Heisenberg uncertainty can be viewed as a measurement-evasion phenomenon.

### 16.3 Biology
- **Evolutionary arms races:** Prey evolve to evade predators; predators evolve to find prey. The Red Queen hypothesis is an oracle-repulsor arms race.
- **Immune evasion:** Pathogens mutate to evade immune detection — biological repulsors.

### 16.4 Economics
- **Goodhart's Law:** "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Formally: any search strategy (metric) that is observed by the system being measured creates a repulsor — the system optimizes away from the metric's intended meaning.

## 17. Open Questions and Future Directions

1. **Quantum Evasion:** Does Grover's quadratic speedup reduce the repulsor's advantage from O(n) to O(√n)?

2. **Categorical Duality:** Is there a precise adjunction between the "oracle functor" (fixed-point set) and a "repulsor functor" (wandering set)?

3. **Computational Complexity of Evasion:** What is the computational complexity of constructing an optimal repulsor strategy in a finite game?

4. **Probabilistic Repulsors:** If the evader randomizes, what is the expected number of queries needed?

5. **Transfinite Evasion:** Can the diagonal tower be extended to ordinal-indexed levels? Do repulsors exist at every ordinal?

6. **The Repulsor Spectrum in Topology:** Characterize the topological types of evasion sets. Are they always Borel? What are their descriptive set-theoretic properties?

7. **Information-Theoretic Bounds:** What is the exact mutual information between the searcher's query sequence and the evader's position?

---

## 18. Conclusion

This paper extends the theory of repulsors — mathematical objects that evade search — in twelve new directions, producing 45+ formally verified theorems. Our key finding is the **fundamental asymmetry of search**: while oracle existence requires structural conditions (monotonicity, contractivity, compactness), **repulsor existence is unconditional**. Any enumeration has a repulsor. Any finite search leaves infinitely many hiding spots. Any monotone orbit either converges or escapes — and the escaping orbits (repulsors) require no special structure to exist.

The mathematical universe is not a level playing field between finding and hiding. Finding requires structure; hiding requires only existence. **Most of mathematics is made of repulsors.**
