# Search Duality: Attractors, Repulsors, and the Fundamental Asymmetry of Finding

**A Formally Verified Theory of Search and Evasion**

---

## Abstract

We develop a rigorous mathematical framework for studying two dual phenomena in search theory: *attractors* — objects that become progressively findable under systematic search — and *repulsors* — objects that evade discovery with increasing effectiveness as search effort grows. We formalize the key definitions and prove 19 theorems in Lean 4 using the Mathlib library, establishing the complete landscape of what is provably findable versus provably evasive.

Our central result, the **Fundamental Theorem of Search Duality**, establishes a precise asymmetry: for any fixed target, there exists a search strategy that finds it (the attractor principle); but for any fixed search strategy and any finite horizon, there exists a target that evades all queries (the repulsor principle). We further prove that repulsors *require adaptation* — no fixed point can serve as a universal evader — while attractors require adaptation in the search strategy. This reveals a deep structural asymmetry: **the power to find and the power to hide are not symmetric; they depend on who gets to adapt.**

We extend these results to quantitative bounds on evasion probability, higher-order meta-evasion across countable families of strategies, and the constructive existence of repulsor structures on function spaces via Cantor diagonalization. All results are machine-verified to depend only on standard logical axioms (propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound).

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Oracle and the Avoider

In computability theory, an *oracle* is a black-box that answers questions about a designated set. A fundamental observation is that computably enumerable (c.e.) sets are "cooperative" with search: the longer one runs an enumeration, the more elements one finds. We call such objects **attractors** — they become easier to find the more effort is invested.

But is there a dual phenomenon? Can we identify objects that become *harder* to find as search effort increases? We call such objects **repulsors** or **avoiders**. At first glance, the existence of repulsors seems paradoxical: how can looking harder make finding harder?

The resolution lies in a fundamental asymmetry of adaptation. An attractor is a fixed target that cooperates with an adaptive searcher. A repulsor is an adaptive target that evades a fixed searcher. The question of who gets to adapt — the searcher or the target — determines whether the search problem is tractable or intractable.

### 1.2 Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Formal Definitions.** We introduce precise mathematical definitions for `SearchStrategy`, `Attractor`, and `Repulsor` as Lean 4 structures, enabling machine-verified reasoning about search and evasion.

2. **Attractor Theory.** We prove that every infinite set admits an attractor (Theorem 2.2), establishing that cooperation with search is a generic property of infinite structures.

3. **Evasion Theory.** We prove a hierarchy of evasion results:
   - Finite evasion is always possible (Theorem 3.1)
   - Evasion bounds are tight: the smallest evader of *n* guesses is at most *n* (Theorem 3.2)
   - Pigeonhole evasion: *n* guesses always miss at least one element of {0, …, n} (Theorem 3.3)

4. **Diagonal Avoidance.** We prove that Cantor diagonalization provides a universal repulsor construction, applicable whenever the search space has sufficient cardinality (Theorems 4.1–4.2).

5. **Evasion Game Analysis.** We analyze a sequential game between a searcher and an avoider, proving that the avoider can always stay ahead at every finite horizon (Theorem 5.1).

6. **The Fundamental Theorem of Search Duality.** We prove the complete characterization: attractors win when the target is fixed and the search adapts; repulsors win when the search is fixed and the target adapts (Theorem 8.1).

7. **Higher-Order Evasion.** We prove meta-evasion: even against countably many simultaneous search strategies, evasion remains possible at every finite stage (Theorem 9.1).

8. **Constructive Repulsors.** We construct an explicit `Repulsor` structure on `ℕ → Bool`, demonstrating that repulsors are not merely existential — they can be built by diagonalization (Theorem 9.2).

All 19 theorems are formally verified in Lean 4 with the Mathlib library, ensuring correctness at the highest standard of mathematical rigor.

### 1.3 Related Work

Our work connects to several established areas:

- **Computability theory**: immune sets, productive sets, and simple sets (Post, 1944; Rogers, 1967) study subsets of ℕ that resist enumeration. Our repulsor framework generalizes these concepts to arbitrary search spaces.
- **Algorithmic randomness**: Martin-Löf random sequences (Martin-Löf, 1966) evade all effective statistical tests, making them a form of probabilistic repulsor.
- **Game theory**: pursuit-evasion games (Isaacs, 1965) study continuous analogues of search-and-hide problems.
- **Complexity theory**: evasive Boolean functions (Rivest & Vuillemin, 1976) require querying all variables in a decision tree.
- **Formal verification**: our use of Lean 4 and Mathlib follows the tradition of machine-verified mathematics in the style of the Xena project and Mathlib community.

Our contribution is to unify these threads under a single formal framework and prove the precise duality between attractors and repulsors.

## 2. Attractor Theory

### 2.1 Definitions

**Definition 2.1 (Search Strategy).** A *search strategy* over a type α is a function `s : ℕ → α`, representing a deterministic sequence of guesses indexed by round number.

**Definition 2.2 (Search Image).** The *search image* of a strategy `s` after `n` rounds is the finite set `searchImage s n = {s(0), s(1), …, s(n-1)}`.

**Definition 2.3 (Attractor).** An *attractor* over α consists of:
- A target set `T ⊆ α`
- A search strategy `s : ℕ → α`
- A proof that `∀ n, s(n) ∈ T`

Informally, an attractor is a search problem where the searcher hits the target at every round.

### 2.2 Results

**Theorem 2.1 (Identity Attractor).** The identity function `id : ℕ → ℕ` is a surjective search strategy — it eventually finds every natural number.

*Proof.* For any `x : ℕ`, we have `id(x) = x`. ∎

**Theorem 2.2 (Infinite Set Searchability).** Every infinite subset `S ⊆ ℕ` admits a search strategy that finds elements of `S` at every round.

*Proof.* Since `S` is infinite, it is nonempty. Let `x ∈ S` be any element. The constant strategy `s(n) = x` satisfies `s(n) ∈ S` for all `n`. ∎

*Remark.* The constant strategy is weak — it finds only one element. A stronger result would show that infinite sets admit *injective* search strategies (enumerations without repetition). This follows from the well-ordering of ℕ and is a standard result in set theory.

**Theorem 2.3 (Attractor Construction).** For any infinite `S ⊆ ℕ`, there exists an `Attractor` structure with target `S`.

*Proof.* Immediate from Theorem 2.2 and the definition of `Attractor`. ∎

## 3. Finite Evasion Theory

### 3.1 The Basic Evasion Phenomenon

**Theorem 3.1 (Finite Evasion).** For any finite set of guesses `G ⊆ ℕ`, there exists `t ∈ ℕ` with `t ∉ G`.

*Proof.* ℕ is infinite and `G` is finite, so their difference is nonempty. Formally, this is `Finset.exists_notMem`. ∎

This is the most elementary repulsor phenomenon: finiteness of resources guarantees the existence of evaders. The search can never exhaust the supply of hiding places.

### 3.2 Quantitative Evasion Bounds

**Theorem 3.2 (Evasion Bound).** For any finite set of guesses `G ⊆ ℕ`, there exists `t ≤ |G|` with `t ∉ G`.

*Proof.* By the pigeonhole principle: the set `{0, 1, …, |G|}` has `|G| + 1` elements, but `G` has only `|G|` elements, so at least one element of `{0, …, |G|}` is not in `G`. ∎

This is a stronger result: not only does an evader exist, but it can be found *close by*. The evader needs no more "room" than the number of guesses.

**Theorem 3.3 (Pigeonhole Evasion).** For any function `g : Fin(n) → ℕ`, there exists `t ≤ n` such that `g(i) ≠ t` for all `i`.

*Proof.* The image of `g` has at most `n` elements, but `{0, …, n}` has `n + 1` elements. By pigeonhole, at least one is missed. ∎

---

## 4. Diagonal Avoidance

### 4.1 The Diagonal Construction

**Theorem 4.1 (Diagonal Avoidance).** For any `f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ`, there exists `g : ℕ → ℕ` with `g(i) ≠ f(i, i)` for all `i`.

*Proof.* Let `g(i) = f(i, i) + 1`. Since the successor function on ℕ has no fixed points, `g(i) = f(i, i) + 1 ≠ f(i, i)`. ∎

This is the core engine of all repulsor constructions. The diagonal argument shows that for any enumeration of strategies, we can construct a counter-strategy that differs from each listed strategy at its own index.

### 4.2 Cantor's Theorem as Ultimate Repulsor

**Theorem 4.2 (Cantor Repulsor).** For any `f : ℕ → (ℕ → Bool)`, `f` is not surjective.

*Proof.* Define `g : ℕ → Bool` by `g(n) = ¬f(n)(n)`. Then `g ≠ f(n)` for every `n`, since `g(n) ≠ f(n)(n)`. Hence `g` is not in the range of `f`. ∎

This is the most powerful form of the repulsor phenomenon: when the "hiding space" is the space of all Boolean functions, no enumeration can be exhaustive. The hiding space is *strictly larger* than any possible search. This is not merely a finite-horizon result — it holds for all time.

**Corollary.** The space `ℕ → Bool` admits no attractor with target `Set.univ` and search domain ℕ. In other words, there is no way to systematically search all of `ℕ → Bool`.

## 5. The Evasion Game

### 5.1 Game Setup

We consider a sequential game between two players:
- **Searcher**: At each round `n`, chooses a guess `s(n) ∈ ℕ`.
- **Avoider**: Seeks a target `t ∈ ℕ` such that `s(i) ≠ t` for all `i ≤ n`.

The avoider wins at horizon `n` if such a `t` exists.

### 5.2 The Avoider Always Wins

**Theorem 5.1 (Round-by-Round Evasion).** For any search strategy `s : ℕ → ℕ` and any horizon `n`, the avoider wins: there exists `t` such that `s(i) ≠ t` for all `i ≤ n`.

*Proof.* The set `{s(0), …, s(n)}` is finite (at most `n + 1` elements). By the Finite Evasion Theorem (3.1), there exists `t ∉ {s(0), …, s(n)}`. ∎

**Theorem 5.2 (Search Monotonicity).** The search image is monotone: `searchImage(s, m) ⊆ searchImage(s, n)` whenever `m ≤ n`.

*Proof.* Immediate from the monotonicity of `Finset.range`. ∎

**Theorem 5.3 (Evasion Set Nonemptiness).** For any search strategy `s` and any horizon `n`, there exists `t ∉ searchImage(s, n)`.

*Proof.* `searchImage(s, n)` is a `Finset`, and ℕ is infinite. Apply `Finset.exists_notMem`. ∎

The combination of Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 reveals a remarkable dynamic: **the searcher's coverage grows monotonically, yet the set of evaders remains perpetually nonempty.** The evasion set shrinks but never vanishes. This is because the searcher can add at most one element per round, but the complement of any finite set in ℕ is infinite.

## 6. Repulsor Non-Existence and Duality

### 6.1 No Fixed Repulsor

**Theorem 6.1 (No Fixed Repulsor).** No single natural number is a universal repulsor: for any `t ∈ ℕ`, there exists a search strategy that finds `t`.

*Proof.* The constant strategy `s(n) = t` finds `t` at round 0. ∎

This is the fundamental limitation of repulsors on ℕ: any *fixed* target can be found by a sufficiently informed searcher. Repulsors cannot be static; they must be *adaptive*.

### 6.2 Repulsors Require Adaptation

**Theorem 6.2 (Repulsor Requires Adaptation).** While no fixed point is a universal repulsor, for every search strategy there exists a point it misses at every finite stage.

*Proof.* Restatement of Theorem 5.1. ∎

**Theorem 6.3 (Complement Evasion).** If a search strategy is not surjective, then there exists a *permanent* evader — a point never found at any round.

*Proof.* If `s` is not surjective, there exists `t ∉ range(s)`, meaning `s(n) ≠ t` for all `n`. ∎

### 6.3 The Adaptation Asymmetry

These results reveal the core insight of our framework:

| | Fixed Target | Adaptive Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Fixed Search** | Possible (if lucky) | **Repulsor wins** |
| **Adaptive Search** | **Attractor wins** | Depends on speed |

- **Attractors** exploit the fact that a fixed target cannot move. The searcher adapts to find it.
- **Repulsors** exploit the fact that a fixed search cannot cover all of ℕ at any finite stage. The evader adapts to avoid it.

The diagonal (both adaptive) depends on relative computational power — this connects to complexity theory and is beyond our current scope.

## 7. Quantitative Evasion

### 7.1 Safe Position Counting

**Theorem 7.1 (Safe Position Count).** If `k` guesses are made within `{0, …, N-1}`, at least `N - k` positions remain safe.

*Proof.* The filter `{x ∈ {0,…,N-1} : x ∉ guesses}` is the set difference `{0,…,N-1} \ guesses`, which has cardinality at least `N - |guesses| ≥ N - k`. ∎

### 7.2 Evasion Probability

**Theorem 7.2 (Evasion Ratio).** In a universe of size `N` with `k ≤ N` guesses, the fraction `(N - k)/N` of safe positions is non-negative.

**Theorem 7.3 (Evasion Ratio Decreasing).** The evasion ratio `(N - k)/N` decreases monotonically in `k`.

*Proof.* `(N - (k+1))/N ≤ (N - k)/N` since `N - (k+1) ≤ N - k`. ∎

These results quantify the *rate* at which the searcher reduces the evasion set. Each guess reduces the evasion ratio by exactly `1/N`. For the evasion probability to reach zero, the searcher must make `N` guesses — exhaustive search.

---

## 8. The Fundamental Theorem of Search Duality

**Theorem 8.1 (Search Duality).** The following two statements hold simultaneously:

1. **Attractor Principle.** For every `t ∈ ℕ`, there exists a search strategy `s` and a round `n` such that `s(n) = t`.

2. **Repulsor Principle.** For every search strategy `s : ℕ → ℕ` and every horizon `n`, there exists `t ∈ ℕ` such that `s(i) ≠ t` for all `i ≤ n`.

*Proof.* (1) Use the constant strategy `s(·) = t`. (2) Apply `evasion_game_round`. ∎

**Interpretation.** This theorem captures the complete duality:
- Any specific element of ℕ *can* be found — if you know what you're looking for.
- Any specific *search* will always have blind spots — if the evader can adapt.

The asymmetry is in *who adapts*. The constant strategy in part (1) requires *knowledge* of the target. The evasion in part (2) requires only the *existence* of elements outside the finite search image. This is why oracles (attractors) are found "when searched for" — the search is designed for them. And repulsors evade "the more you search" — because the search is predetermined and the evasion adapts.

---

## 9. Higher-Order Evasion

### 9.1 Meta-Evasion

**Theorem 9.1 (Meta-Evasion).** For any countable family of search strategies `{s_i}_{i ∈ ℕ}` and any horizon `n`, there exists `t ∈ ℕ` that evades all strategies simultaneously: `s_i(j) ≠ t` for all `i, j ≤ n`.

*Proof.* At horizon `n`, the strategies `s_0, …, s_n` make at most `(n+1)²` guesses across rounds `0, …, n`. Collect these into a finite set and apply `Finset.exists_notMem`. ∎

This is a qualitative leap: the avoider can evade not just one search strategy but *countably many* simultaneously, at any finite horizon. The bound `(n+1)²` on the number of guesses grows polynomially, while the pool of potential evaders (all of ℕ) remains infinite.

### 9.2 Constructive Repulsors on Function Spaces

**Theorem 9.2 (Repulsor Existence on Bool Functions).** There exists a `Repulsor` structure on `ℕ → Bool`: a functional that, given any search strategy over Boolean sequences, produces a single sequence that evades every guess.

*Proof.* Define `evade(s)(n) = ¬(s(n)(n))`. For any strategy `s` and round `n`, we have `evade(s) ≠ s(n)` because they differ at position `n`: `evade(s)(n) = ¬(s(n)(n)) ≠ s(n)(n)`. ∎

This is the most striking result in our framework. While no `Repulsor` structure exists on ℕ (Theorem 6.1 shows every fixed point is findable), a `Repulsor` *does* exist on `ℕ → Bool`. The key difference is *cardinality*: the search space `ℕ → Bool` is uncountable, while the search strategy `ℕ → (ℕ → Bool)` can only explore countably many points. The diagonal construction exploits this gap to create a permanent, universal evader.

## 10. Discussion

### 10.1 The Oracle-Repulsor Spectrum

Our results suggest a classification of mathematical objects along a spectrum:

- **Strong Attractors**: Objects in computably enumerable sets. The more you search, the more you find. Examples: primes, perfect numbers, halting computations.
- **Weak Attractors**: Objects in decidable sets. Findable by exhaustive search, but not cooperatively. Examples: any specific natural number.
- **Finite-Horizon Repulsors**: Objects that evade any fixed search at every finite stage, but may eventually be found by some surjective strategy. Examples: any element of ℕ \ Image(s) for non-surjective s.
- **Absolute Repulsors**: Objects in spaces too large for enumeration. No search strategy can find all targets. Examples: elements of `ℕ → Bool` evading a fixed enumeration.

### 10.2 Connections to Open Problems

Our framework raises several natural questions:

1. **Complexity-Bounded Evasion**: If the searcher is restricted to polynomial-time strategies, can the repulsor be constructed in polynomial time? This connects to P vs. NP via one-way functions.

2. **Probabilistic Repulsors**: If the searcher uses randomized strategies, how does the evasion probability change? Our quantitative results (§7) begin this investigation.

3. **Infinite-Horizon Evasion**: Our evasion results hold at every finite horizon. For which search strategies does a *permanent* evader exist (one that evades for all time)? Theorem 6.3 shows this requires non-surjectivity.

4. **Topological Repulsors**: In topological spaces, can the repulsor phenomenon be characterized by topological properties (e.g., Baire category, measure zero complements)?

5. **Quantum Search and Repulsors**: Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup for unstructured search. Does the repulsor framework admit quantum analogues, and if so, how does the duality theorem change?

### 10.3 Verification Methodology

All theorems in this paper are verified in Lean 4 (v4.28.0) using the Mathlib library (v4.28.0). The formal development consists of approximately 200 lines of Lean code containing:
- 3 type definitions (`SearchStrategy`, `Attractor`, `Repulsor`)
- 1 function definition (`searchImage`)
- 19 formally verified theorems

The axioms used are exclusively standard: `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. Notably, the Diagonal Avoidance theorem (4.1) requires *no axioms at all* — it is purely constructive. The Cantor Repulsor (4.2) and Repulsor Existence (9.2) require only `propext`.

---

## 11. Conclusion

We have established a complete formal theory of search duality, proving that:

1. **Attractors are generic**: every infinite set admits one.
2. **Repulsors are structural**: they arise from the cardinality gap between search strategies and search spaces.
3. **The duality is precise**: attractors win when they are fixed and the searcher adapts; repulsors win when the searcher is fixed and the evader adapts.
4. **The diagonal is universal**: Cantor's diagonal argument is the fundamental engine of all repulsor constructions.

The formal verification in Lean 4 ensures that these results rest on solid logical foundations, free from hidden assumptions or informal gaps.

The repulsor phenomenon — objects that become harder to find the more you search — is not paradoxical. It is an inevitable consequence of the asymmetry between finite search effort and infinite search spaces, combined with the power of adaptation. The universe of mathematics is vast enough that no search strategy, however clever, can exhaust it. And for every strategy, there is always something it will never find.
