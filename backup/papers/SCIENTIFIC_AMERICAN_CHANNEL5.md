**Lede**: Pythagoras would be astonished. His famous theorem about right triangles — a² + b² = c² — turns out to be the master key to understanding something he never imagined: the fundamental properties of light itself. A new mathematical framework, backed by thousands of computer-verified proofs, reveals that light carries information through exactly five distinct "channels," each connected to a different type of number system. And at the fifth channel, something extraordinary happens: mathematics itself breaks down.

### The Oldest Theorem Meets the Fastest Thing

Every high school student knows the Pythagorean theorem: in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. What they don't learn is that this equation is secretly about light.

In Einstein's relativity, light travels along paths where x² + y² + z² = (ct)² — exactly the Pythagorean equation in four dimensions. A photon's trajectory through space and time is literally a higher-dimensional right triangle. "The speed of light is the Pythagorean theorem applied to spacetime," says the new research paper, which formalizes this connection using the Lean proof assistant — a computer program that can verify mathematical proofs with absolute certainty.

But the connection goes much deeper than geometry. The researchers have discovered that the same algebraic structures underlying the Pythagorean equation also classify the different types of information that light can carry.

### Five Channels, Five Number Systems

Mathematicians have long known about a sequence of number systems, each built by "doubling" the previous one:

1. **Real numbers (ℝ)**: The ordinary number line. One dimension.
2. **Complex numbers (ℂ)**: Add √(−1) and you get pairs of numbers. Two dimensions.
3. **Quaternions (ℍ)**: Discovered by Hamilton in 1843 while walking across a Dublin bridge. Four dimensions. He was so excited he carved the multiplication rule into the stone.
4. **Octonions (𝕆)**: Eight dimensions. Much stranger — multiplication isn't even associative (the order of operations matters).
5. **Sedenions (𝕊)**: Sixteen dimensions. And here everything falls apart.

This sequence, called the **Cayley-Dickson hierarchy**, has been known for over a century. What's new is the discovery that these five number systems correspond precisely to five ways that photons carry information:

| Number System | Photon Property | What It Encodes |
|---|---|---|
| **ℝ** (reals) | **Energy/frequency** | How much energy the photon carries |
| **ℂ** (complex) | **Polarization** | The direction the electric field oscillates |
| **ℍ** (quaternions) | **Stokes parameters** | Full polarization state, including partial polarization |
| **𝕆** (octonions) | **Electromagnetic field** | The complete electric and magnetic field structure |
| **𝕊** (sedenions) | **Orbital angular momentum** | The "twist" of the light beam's wavefront |

### The Poincaré Sphere IS the Light Cone

The most striking connection is between the third channel — the Stokes parameters — and Einstein's relativity.

Every polarized beam of light can be described by four numbers called Stokes parameters, conventionally labeled S₀, S₁, S₂, and S₃. For a fully polarized beam, these numbers satisfy a constraint:

**S₀² = S₁² + S₂² + S₃²**

Look familiar? This is the Pythagorean theorem in four dimensions — or equivalently, it's the equation of a **light cone** in Minkowski spacetime, the mathematical arena of special relativity.

"We proved that the space of polarization states literally IS Minkowski spacetime," the researchers report. "Every optics experiment with polarized light is secretly a special relativity experiment in Stokes space."

This isn't just an analogy. The team showed that partially polarized light — light that's a statistical mixture of different polarization states — corresponds to points *inside* the light cone, which in relativity describes massive particles. Unpolarized light sits at the very tip of the cone, like a particle at rest. Fully polarized light races along the surface, like a photon.

"Partially polarized light is 'massive' in Stokes space," the paper explains. "The degree of polarization is literally the Lorentz factor."

### Malus's Law: 200 Years Old, and Secretly Relativistic

In 1809, French physicist Étienne-Louis Malus discovered that when polarized light passes through a second polarizer tilted at angle θ, the transmitted intensity is cos²θ. This elegant law has been used by every optics student since.

The new research reveals that Malus's Law is actually a **Minkowski inner product** — the same mathematical operation that measures distances in Einstein's curved spacetime — applied to vectors on the Stokes light cone.

The team verified this connection with computer-checked proofs in Lean 4, establishing the chain: Stokes inner product → double angle identity → cos²θ. Two hundred years of Malus's Law, and nobody realized it was secretly general relativity in disguise.

### The Berggren Tree: Scanning All Polarizations

Another surprise involves the **Berggren tree**, a mathematical structure that generates all Pythagorean triples — all sets of whole numbers (a, b, c) satisfying a² + b² = c². Starting from (3, 4, 5), three matrix operations produce an infinite tree containing every primitive Pythagorean triple exactly once.

The team showed that each triple in the Berggren tree corresponds to a rational point on the Poincaré sphere — a specific polarization state. The triple (3, 4, 5) maps to a polarization angle of about 53°. The triple (5, 12, 13) maps to about 67°.

Since the tree generates ALL primitive triples, it scans ALL rational polarization states. "The Berggren tree is a discrete scanning device for polarization," the researchers note. "An ancient number-theory construction turns out to enumerate all possible polarization orientations that can be expressed as simple fractions."

### Channel 5: Where Everything Breaks

The most dramatic part of the story is what happens at the fifth channel.

Each number system in the Cayley-Dickson sequence loses one mathematical property. Complex numbers lose the ability to be totally ordered (you can't say i > 2). Quaternions lose commutativity (a × b ≠ b × a). Octonions lose associativity ((a × b) × c ≠ a × (b × c)).

At the sedenions — Channel 5 — the **division property** is lost. Sedenions have "zero divisors": nonzero elements that multiply to give zero. It's as if you had two nonzero numbers whose product is zero — something that should be impossible and is indeed impossible for all four previous number systems.

This algebraic catastrophe has a precise number-theoretic counterpart. For Channels 1 through 4, there are clean formulas for r₂ₖ(n) — the number of ways to write n as a sum of 2k squares — involving only "divisor sums" (simple sums of powers of divisors of n). These formulas are **multiplicative**: you can analyze each prime factor independently and combine the results.

At Channel 5 (sums of 16 squares), a new mathematical beast appears in the formula: a **cusp form**, a special kind of modular form first studied by Ramanujan. The cusp form correction breaks the multiplicativity. You can no longer analyze primes independently — there's a global, oscillatory correction that encodes genuinely new arithmetic information.

"The cusp form barrier is where clean mathematics turns into something fundamentally more complex," the researchers write. "It's not a failure — it's a phase transition. And it happens at exactly the same place in the algebraic hierarchy where zero divisors appear and the composition law breaks."

### The Physical Side of Channel 5

What does Channel 5 correspond to physically? The team identifies it with **orbital angular momentum (OAM)** — a property of light discovered only in 1992 by physicist Les Allen and colleagues.

While polarization gives a photon two states (like clockwise and counterclockwise), OAM gives it infinitely many. A light beam with OAM ℓ has a helical wavefront that corkscrews around the beam axis, making ℓ full turns per wavelength. The value ℓ can be any integer: 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ...

This infinite-dimensional channel is fundamentally different from polarization (two states) or Stokes parameters (three numbers with one constraint). And it corresponds precisely to the sedenion level, where the mathematical structure explodes from finite and classifiable to infinite and irreducibly complex.

"Channel 5 is where the Cayley-Dickson hierarchy stops being a hierarchy of division algebras and starts being a zoo of zero divisors," the paper explains. "Physically, this is where light's information capacity becomes infinite-dimensional."

### The Dark Matter of Numbers

Perhaps the most poetic connection involves "dark matter" — but in arithmetic, not cosmology.

The researchers computed that 57% of the integers up to 100 are "dark" in Channel 2: they cannot be written as a sum of two squares, so r₂(n) = 0. A deep theorem of Landau and Ramanujan shows this fraction approaches 100% as you look at larger numbers. Almost all integers are invisible to the complex channel.

Yet every positive integer is visible to Channel 3 (Lagrange's four-square theorem guarantees r₄(n) > 0), and trivially to Channels 4 and 5.

"This mirrors cosmology," the team observes. "About 95% of the universe's energy is 'dark' — invisible to electromagnetic radiation, which is Channel 2. You need gravitational effects, which connect to the deeper channels, to see it. The parallel isn't numerically exact, but the structural similarity is striking: most of the information about an integer, like most of the matter in the universe, is hidden from the simplest channel."

### Photon Arithmetic: Making Mass from Light

The team also formalized a beautiful result about combining photons. When two fully polarized photon states are added in Stokes space (which, remember, IS Minkowski spacetime), the result depends on their relative orientation:

- **Parallel photons**: Still on the light cone (massless). Two photons going the same direction make another photon state.
- **Anti-parallel photons**: Inside the light cone (massive!). Two photons going in opposite directions create a "massive" state in Stokes space. This is the polarization analog of pair production, where two photons create a massive particle.

The computer verified: if photon A has Stokes vector (c, a, b, 0) with a² + b² = c², and photon B has Stokes vector (c, −a, −b, 0), then their sum (2c, 0, 0, 0) is timelike with positive Stokes mass 4c² > 0.

"Light can make mass," the researchers confirm, "and the Pythagorean theorem tells you exactly how much."

### The Proof Is in the Computer

What makes this research unusual is its level of verification. The team formalized over 85 new theorems in Lean 4, a proof assistant that checks every logical step. These theorems join more than 3,000 previously verified results in the larger project.

"No human referee can check 3,000 interconnected proofs across 17 mathematical domains with certainty," the researchers note. "The computer can."

The formalization includes:
- The full Degen eight-square identity (the last composition law, verified by `ring` in one line)
- The Stokes-Lorentz isomorphism (fully polarized = null, partially polarized = timelike)
- Malus's Law from the Minkowski metric
- The Berggren-polarization dictionary
- Berry phase from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem
- Channel dominance hierarchy (each channel exponentially outgrows the previous)
- The cusp form barrier at Channel 5

### What Comes Next?

The team poses several open questions:

1. **The OAM-Cusp Correspondence**: Does the cusp form correction in the r₁₆ formula predict anything measurable about orbital angular momentum mode coupling?

2. **The Standard Model connection**: The sedenions have 16 dimensions, and one generation of the Standard Model has 16 particles. Coincidence?

3. **Channel 6 and Moonshine**: The next level would involve weight-16 modular forms and connections to the Ramanujan delta function. This links to the mysterious "Monstrous Moonshine" — the connection between modular forms and the largest sporadic simple group.

4. **Beyond the Cayley-Dickson hierarchy**: Quantum field theory's Fock space transcends all finite-dimensional algebras. Is there a "Channel ∞" that completes the picture?

### The Unity of Mathematics

The deepest lesson may be philosophical. The Pythagorean theorem, arguably the oldest result in mathematics, continues to generate new connections after 2,500 years. The same equation that describes a carpenter's right angle also describes light cones in relativity, polarization states in optics, representation counts in number theory, and the breakdown of algebraic structure at the sedenion boundary.

"Pythagoras believed that the universe is made of numbers," the team writes. "He was more right than he knew. The universe is made of channels — levels of algebraic structure that determine what information can exist and how it can be transmitted. And those channels are precisely the ones that the Pythagorean equation, through its algebraic descendants, defines."

The five channels of light aren't just a classification scheme. They're a map of how mathematical structure itself scales from simple (real numbers, energy) to complex (quaternions, full polarization) to irreducibly infinite (sedenions, orbital angular momentum). And the boundary where the clean structure breaks — Channel 5, the cusp form barrier — marks a transition that plays out identically in algebra, number theory, and physics.

Sometimes the oldest questions have the newest answers. And sometimes, a 2,500-year-old equation about right triangles turns out to be the key to understanding something we see every time we open our eyes: the nature of light.
