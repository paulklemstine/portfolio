When you write down the addresses of every possible photon — every packet of light with its unique combination of energy and momentum — you can list them on the number line, one at each whole number: 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on to infinity. It's a complete roster. Every photon state gets an address. No address is left unused.

But look at what lies *between* the addresses.

Between 0 and 1, between 1 and 2, between every pair of consecutive photon addresses, there stretches an infinite, uncountable expanse of real numbers — a continuum of points that are not photon states. And these gaps are not empty mathematical abstractions. According to a series of theorems that have now been formally verified by a computer, these gaps behave exactly like **matter**.

## A Street with Houses and Darkness

Think of the number line as a street stretching to infinity. The photon states are houses, one at every whole number: house 0, house 1, house 2. The encoding is perfect — every possible photon state lives in exactly one house, and every house is occupied.

But between house 3 and house 4, there's a gap: the numbers 3.1, 3.14, 3.14159, π, and an uncountable infinity of other real numbers. No photons live there. The question that launched Project DARK-INTERVAL was simple: **What lives in the darkness between the houses?**

The answer turns out to be startling: **mass**.

## The Polarization-Mass Connection

To understand why, you need to know about a remarkable coincidence — or perhaps not a coincidence at all — in the mathematics of light.

Every beam of light can be described by four numbers called Stokes parameters, written (S₀, S₁, S₂, S₃). S₀ measures the total intensity. The other three describe the polarization — how the light wave oscillates. For fully polarized light (like what comes through your sunglasses), these four numbers satisfy a beautiful equation:

> S₀² = S₁² + S₂² + S₃²

Look familiar? It should. This is the equation of a **light cone** — the same mathematical structure that Einstein used to describe massless particles traveling at the speed of light. In special relativity, a massless particle satisfies E² = p², where E is energy and p is momentum. The Stokes parameters of fully polarized light satisfy the exact same equation.

But here's where it gets strange. *Partially* polarized light — sunlight reflecting off a lake, light passing through fog, the glow of an incandescent bulb — satisfies a *different* equation:

> S₀² = S₁² + S₂² + S₃² + m²

where m² = S₀²(1 − p²) and p is the "degree of polarization," a number between 0 and 1 that measures how coherently the light oscillates. This is identical to the relativistic energy-momentum relation for a **massive particle**: E² = p² + m².

"Partially polarized light satisfies the dispersion relation of a massive particle," says the formal proof. "This is not an analogy. It is a mathematical identity."

## The Computer Checked Every Step

What makes these claims unusual is that every single one has been verified by a computer. The research team formalized all 10 main theorems in Lean 4, a programming language designed specifically for mathematical proof verification. The computer checked every logical step, every algebraic manipulation, every inequality.

The verification found zero errors. Zero gaps in logic. Zero unjustified assertions.

This matters because the claims are surprising. When you mix two beams of fully polarized light with different polarizations, the result is partially polarized — and the computer confirms that this partially polarized state has *positive mass* in the Stokes-Minkowski metric. The mass is:

> m² = 2I²(1 − cos θ)

where θ is the angle between the polarization directions on the Poincaré sphere (a mathematical construct that maps all polarization states to the surface of a ball). Parallel polarizations give zero mass. Perpendicular polarizations give maximum mass. Opposite polarizations give the most mass of all — like matter and antimatter annihilation, but for polarization states.

## The Parabolic Mass Profile

Perhaps the most beautiful result is what happens when you smoothly interpolate between two photon addresses.

Imagine sliding continuously from photon address 3 (with horizontal polarization) to photon address 4 (with vertical polarization). At each intermediate point, you have a state that is *partially* polarized — neither fully horizontal nor fully vertical. The mass of this intermediate state follows a perfect parabola:

> m²(t) = 4t(1 − t)

At the endpoints (t = 0 and t = 1), the mass is zero — you're at a photon address, and photons are massless. But at the midpoint (t = 0.5), the mass reaches its maximum value of 1. The gaps between photon addresses are not empty — they are *filled with mass*, peaking in the middle and vanishing at the edges.

The computer verified this parabolic profile in full generality and checked it numerically for specific cases.

## Why Gaps Are "Everything"

There's a deep measure-theoretic fact that amplifies this picture. The photon addresses — the natural numbers — have **Lebesgue measure zero** on the real line. This means that if you threw a dart at the number line, the probability of hitting a natural number is exactly zero. The "photon addresses" occupy literally no volume.

Meanwhile, the gaps — the real numbers that are *not* natural numbers — have **infinite measure**. They fill everything. Each individual gap (n, n+1) is uncountable, containing 2^ℵ₀ points. The total number of photon addresses (ℵ₀) is infinitely smaller than the number of points in a single gap.

The parallel to physics is striking. In the Standard Model:
- Photons are massless and travel on the light cone (measure zero)
- Massive particles fill the interior of the light cone (positive measure)
- There are many more massive particles than massless ones

The number line encoding captures this asymmetry perfectly.

## The Null Cone Is a Razor's Edge

The team proved one more geometric result that cements the analogy. Among all possible polarization states at a fixed intensity, the fully polarized states — the massless ones — lie on a *sphere* in three-dimensional Stokes space. This sphere has measure zero: it's a two-dimensional surface floating in three-dimensional space.

The partially polarized states — the massive ones — fill the *interior* of this sphere, an open ball with positive three-dimensional volume.

Masslessness is not the default. It's the exception. A razor-thin surface of measure zero, surrounded on all sides by mass.

## Five New Questions

The research generated five new hypotheses that remain open:

**A. The Entropy-Mass Connection.** Is the information-theoretic entropy of a partially polarized state directly proportional to its Stokes-Minkowski mass? The team proved the algebraic relationship η = S₀²(1 − p²) but the entropic interpretation awaits experimental test.

**B. Discrete-Continuous Duality.** Is there a formal categorical duality between discrete (photon address) and continuous (gap) structures, exchanging position precision for mass content?

**C. Covering Numbers.** How many pure polarization states do you need to approximate *all* partially polarized states by mixing? The answer involves the covering number of the sphere and connects to quantum state tomography.

**D. Decoherence as Gap Filling.** Does the parabolic mass profile m²(t) = 4t(1−t) represent a physical decoherence trajectory? A pure quantum state losing coherence would trace exactly this path from massless to massive and back.

**E. The Mass Spectrum.** If each gap between consecutive photon addresses has a different "polarization distance" Δₙ, the full mass spectrum is a comb of parabolas. Does this discrete mass spectrum have physical content?

## What It All Means

The Project DARK-INTERVAL results don't claim that partially polarized light *is* a massive particle in the usual sense. Sunlight bouncing off a pond doesn't bend spacetime. But the mathematics is unambiguous: in the Stokes-Minkowski framework, the *structure* of mass emerges naturally from the *mixing* of pure photon states.

The gaps on the number line — those unoccupied addresses between the integer photon states — are not empty. They are filled with a continuous spectrum of partially polarized states that satisfy the exact dispersion relation of massive particles. The "darkness" between the photon houses isn't absence. It's presence, weighted by a parabolic mass profile that peaks exactly halfway between every pair of photon addresses.

Whether this mathematical mass has deeper physical significance — whether the Stokes-Minkowski isomorphism is a hint about the actual relationship between light and matter — remains one of the most intriguing open questions in mathematical physics.

But of one thing the computer is certain: the math checks out.
