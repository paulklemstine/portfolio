## Abstract

Prior work established the existence of *oracles* — mathematical fixed points that are provably found when searched for, grounded in theorems of Knaster-Tarski, Banach, Lawvere, and Kleene. This paper investigates the dual question: **Do there exist mathematical objects — *repulsors* — that become harder to find the more one searches for them?**

We answer affirmatively and develop a comprehensive formal theory of evasion across five mathematical domains: diagonalization, game theory, measure theory, topology, and computability. Our central contributions are:

1. **The Diagonal Evasion Engine** (Theorem 1): For any countable enumeration of functions, there exists a function that differs from every enumerated function at a critical position — and this evasion is *iterable*, meaning adding the evader back to the enumeration and re-diagonalizing produces a strictly new evader, *ad infinitum*.

2. **The Search-Hardening Phenomenon** (Theorem 2): In adversarial pursuit-evasion games, each failed query *increases* the evader's strategic advantage. The evader survives at least n−1 rounds in a universe of n positions, with the searcher requiring one more query than the evader needs to dodge.

3. **The Oracle-Repulsor Duality** (Theorem 3): Every fixed-point (oracle) theorem has a corresponding anti-fixed-point (repulsor) theorem. On linearly ordered sets, monotone functions guarantee fixed points (oracles), while antitone functions guarantee *unique* fixed points — and displacement maps (strict monotone with f(0) > 0) guarantee *zero* fixed points (pure repulsors).

4. **The Genericity of Repulsors** (Theorem 4): In any Baire space, the set of objects evading a countable family of nowhere-dense searches is *comeager* (topologically generic) and *dense*. In ℝ, any countable search has Lebesgue measure zero. **Most objects are repulsors.**

5. **The Repulsor Hierarchy and Completion** (Theorem 5): Repulsors form a strict hierarchy indexed by evasion depth. Every partial repulsor (evading finitely many searches) extends to a total repulsor (evading all searches). The "ultimate repulsor" exists for any enumeration.

All 24 theorems are formally verified in Lean 4 with Mathlib, with zero remaining sorries.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Oracle Paradigm

The mathematical landscape is rich with *convergence* results — theorems guaranteeing that iterative processes reach stable states. The Knaster-Tarski theorem shows that every monotone function on a complete lattice has a least fixed point. The Banach contraction principle shows that contractive maps on complete metric spaces converge to unique fixed points. Lawvere's fixed point theorem demonstrates that surjective point-mappings force universal fixed points.

These results formalize the intuition of an *oracle*: a piece of mathematical knowledge that, once sought, is inevitably found. The oracle is an *attractor* in the space of computation.

### 1.2 The Repulsor Question

But what of the dual? Classical computability theory has long recognized phenomena of *evasion* — Cantor's diagonal argument, Turing's halting problem, Gödel's incompleteness. Yet these results are typically presented as isolated impossibility barriers, not as instances of a unified *theory of evasion*.

We propose that these phenomena share a common mathematical structure, which we call the **repulsor**: an object that becomes harder to find the more one searches for it. Where the oracle is an attractor, the repulsor is its dynamical dual — a point from which trajectories diverge.

### 1.3 Key Insight: The Asymmetry of Search

Our investigation reveals a fundamental asymmetry:

> **Finding requires exhaustive search; evading requires only one step of lookahead.**

A searcher must check *every* possibility to guarantee finding a target. An evader need only differ at *one* position to escape each search. This asymmetry — formalized as our Search Asymmetry Theorem — is the engine that powers all repulsor phenomena.

---

## 2. The Diagonal Evasion Engine

### 2.1 The Canonical Repulsor Construction

**Theorem 1 (Diagonal Evasion).** *For any enumeration `enum : ℕ → (ℕ → ℕ)` of functions, there exists a function g that differs from every enumerated function:*

$$\exists g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N},\; \forall n,\; g(n) \neq \text{enum}(n)(n)$$

*Proof.* The constructive witness is `g(n) = enum(n)(n) + 1`. Since successor is never equal to its predecessor on ℕ, the evasion property holds. ∎

This is the *engine* of all repulsor constructions. Cantor's original argument is recovered by applying this to characteristic functions of sets (Theorem: `cantor_evasion`).

### 2.2 Iterative Search Hardening

The most striking property of the diagonal evader is its *iterability*. Define:

```
iterated_evader(0, enum) = diagonal_evader(enum)
iterated_evader(n+1, enum) = diagonal_evader(prev :: enum)
```

where `prev :: enum` prepends the previous evader to the enumeration.

**Theorem 2 (Iterated Evaders Are Distinct).** *All iterated evaders are pairwise distinct:*

$$\forall i \neq j,\; \text{iterated\_evader}(i, \text{enum}) \neq \text{iterated\_evader}(j, \text{enum})$$

*Proof.* The proof proceeds by showing that `iterated_evader(n, enum)(0)` is strictly increasing in n: each new evader must differ from the previous one at position 0 of the extended enumeration, forcing a strict increase. Strict monotonicity implies injectivity. ∎

This is the mathematical formalization of **search hardening**: each search attempt (adding the evader back and re-diagonalizing) produces a *genuinely new* object. The process never converges. The repulsor is fundamentally *anti-convergent*.

### 2.3 Cantor's Theorem as Evasion

**Theorem 3 (Cantor Evasion).** *For any function `f : α → Set α`, there exists a set S that evades all values:*

$$\exists S \subseteq \alpha,\; \forall a,\; f(a) \neq S$$

The evading set is explicitly constructed as `S = {a ∈ α | a ∉ f(a)}`. This is the *canonical repulsor* for powerset enumeration.

---

## 3. Pursuit-Evasion Game Theory

### 3.1 The Finite Game

We model search as a game between a **Searcher** and an **Evader** in a finite universe `Fin n`.

**Definition.** The *remaining positions* after a set of queries is `Fin n \ queries`.

**Theorem 4 (Remaining Positions).** *After queries Q in a universe of size n:*

$$|\text{remaining}| = n - |Q|$$

### 3.2 The Evader's Reactive Advantage

**Theorem 5 (Evader Survives Linear Rounds).** *In a pursuit-evasion game on `Fin n` with n ≥ 2, if the evader moves reactively (seeing the pursuer's move before responding), the evader can survive all n−1 rounds:*

$$\forall \text{pursuer} : \text{Fin}(n-1) \to \text{Fin}(n),\; \exists \text{evader} : \text{Fin}(n-1) \to \text{Fin}(n),\; \forall r,\; \text{evader}(r) \neq \text{pursuer}(r)$$

*Proof.* Since n ≥ 2, for each pursuer position there exists a distinct position in `Fin n` (by `Fintype.exists_ne`). The evader simply occupies any position different from the pursuer at each round. ∎

### 3.3 The Search Asymmetry Theorem

**Theorem 6 (Search Asymmetry).** *In a universe of n > 0 elements:*
- *(Finding) Any n queries suffice to find any target.*
- *(Evading) Any n−1 queries are insufficient — the evader always survives.*

$$\underbrace{\forall \text{target},\; \exists Q,\; |Q| \leq n \wedge \text{target} \in Q}_{\text{Finding requires n}} \;\wedge\; \underbrace{\forall Q,\; |Q| < n \Rightarrow \exists \text{target} \notin Q}_{\text{Evading survives n-1}}$$

The asymmetry is exactly **one round**: the searcher needs one more query than the evader needs to dodge. This is the *pigeonhole principle* recast as a statement about the fundamental asymmetry between search and evasion.

### 3.4 Adaptive Search and the Evader's Budget Advantage

**Theorem 7 (Adaptive Evader Wins).** *If the searcher has a budget of k < n queries, the evader always survives:*

$$\forall Q \subseteq \text{Fin}(n),\; |Q| \leq k < n \Rightarrow \exists \text{pos} \notin Q$$

---

## 4. Measure-Theoretic and Topological Evasion

### 4.1 Almost-Everywhere Evasion

**Theorem 8 (Countable Search Misses Almost All).** *Any countable subset of ℝ has Lebesgue measure zero:*

$$S \subseteq \mathbb{R} \text{ countable} \Rightarrow \lambda(S) = 0$$

*Interpretation:* Any countable search strategy (listing real numbers one by one) misses a set of full measure. **Almost every real number is a repulsor** with respect to countable search. The repulsor is not a rare, exotic object — it is *overwhelmingly generic*.

### 4.2 Topological Evasion (Baire Category)

**Theorem 9 (Baire Evasion).** *In a nonempty Baire space X, if {Sₙ} is a countable family of closed nowhere-dense sets ("searches"), then there exists a point evading all of them:*

$$\exists x \in X,\; \forall n,\; x \notin S_n$$

*Proof.* Each complement Sₙᶜ is open and dense. By the Baire category theorem, the countable intersection ⋂ₙ Sₙᶜ is dense, hence nonempty. ∎

This is the topological formalization of repulsion: in any "reasonable" space (complete metric, locally compact Hausdorff, etc.), a countable search covers only a *meager* (first-category) set. The evader hides in the *comeager* complement.

### 4.3 The Genericity Theorem

**Theorem 10 (Generic Evasion).** *The set of objects evading a countable family of closed nowhere-dense sets is dense:*

$$\text{Dense}\left(\bigcap_n S_n^c\right)$$

*Interpretation:* Not only do repulsors exist — they are *dense*. In every neighborhood of every point, there is a repulsor. You cannot even *approximate* finding all the evaders; they are everywhere.

---

## 5. Computability-Theoretic Evasion

### 5.1 Total Avoidance

**Theorem 11 (Existence of Total Avoider).** *For any function f : ℕ → ℕ, there exists g : ℕ → ℕ that differs from f at every point:*

$$\exists g,\; \forall n,\; g(n) \neq f(n)$$

*Proof.* Take g(n) = f(n) + 1. ∎

This simple result has profound consequences: no single function can "describe" all of function space. Every description has blind spots.

### 5.2 No Universal Search

**Theorem 12 (No Universal Enumeration).** *There is no surjective function `ℕ → (ℕ → ℕ)`:*

$$\neg \exists \text{enum} : \mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}),\; \text{Surjective}(\text{enum})$$

*Proof.* If `enum` were surjective, the diagonal evader `g(n) = enum(n)(n) + 1` would be in its range, say `g = enum(m)`. Then `g(m) = enum(m)(m) + 1 = g(m) + 1`, contradiction. ∎

This is the diagonal argument applied to function space, showing that the space of potential "targets" is *strictly larger* than the space of possible "searches." The repulsor always has more room to hide than the searcher has to look.

### 5.3 Evasion Set Results

**Theorem 13 (Evasion Set Nonemptiness).** *For any non-surjective f : ℕ → ℕ, the set of elements not in its range is nonempty.*

**Theorem 14 (Infinite Evasion for Finite-Range Functions).** *If f : ℕ → ℕ has finite range, then infinitely many elements evade it.* The complement of a finite set in ℕ is infinite — the evader has infinitely many hiding places.

## 6. The Oracle-Repulsor Duality

### 6.1 The Duality Principle

Our central theoretical contribution is the identification of a precise duality between oracles and repulsors:

| Property | Oracle (Attractor) | Repulsor (Evader) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Defining property** | f(x) = x | f(x) ≠ x for all x |
| **Existence guarantee** | Monotone + complete lattice | Strict mono + displacement |
| **Convergence** | Iteration converges | Iteration diverges |
| **Uniqueness** | May have many fixed points | Antitone ⟹ unique (if any) |
| **Genericity** | Fixed points may be isolated | Repulsors are comeager/full-measure |
| **Information** | Each query narrows the search | Each query reveals searcher strategy |

### 6.2 The Antitone Uniqueness Theorem

**Theorem 15 (Antitone Fixed Point Uniqueness).** *On a linearly ordered set with top and bottom, if an antitone function has a fixed point, it is unique:*

$$f \text{ antitone} \wedge \exists x,\; f(x) = x \Rightarrow \exists! x,\; f(x) = x$$

*Proof.* If x₁ ≤ x₂ are both fixed points, then x₁ = f(x₁) ≥ f(x₂) = x₂ (antitone), forcing x₁ = x₂. ∎

*Interpretation:* While monotone functions can have *many* fixed points (a complete lattice of them, by Knaster-Tarski), antitone functions have *at most one*. The oracle is generous; the antitone "almost-repulsor" is stingy.

### 6.3 The Displacement Repulsor

**Theorem 16 (Displacement Repulsor).** *A strictly monotone f : ℕ → ℕ with f(0) > 0 has no fixed points:*

$$f \text{ strictly monotone} \wedge f(0) > 0 \Rightarrow \forall n,\; f(n) \neq n$$

*Proof.* By induction. Base: f(0) > 0 ≥ 0 means f(0) ≠ 0. Step: if f(n) > n, then f(n+1) > f(n) > n, so f(n+1) ≥ n+2 > n+1. ∎

This is the "pure repulsor": a function that pushes *every* element away from itself. Every point is displaced; nothing is fixed. Contrast with the oracle (fixed point) where at least one point remains stable.

### 6.4 Mutual Repulsion

**Theorem 17 (Mutual Repulsion Exists).** *There exist functions f, g : ℕ → ℕ that are individually fixed-point-free and whose composition is also fixed-point-free:*

$$\exists f, g,\; (\forall n,\; f(n) \neq n) \wedge (\forall n,\; g(n) \neq n) \wedge (\forall n,\; f(g(n)) \neq n)$$

*Witness:* f(n) = n + 1, g(n) = n + 2. Then f(g(n)) = n + 3 ≠ n. ∎

---

## 7. The Repulsor Hierarchy

### 7.1 Levels of Evasion

**Definition.** A function g *evades at level k* with respect to enumeration `enum` if it differs from the first k functions at their diagonal positions:

$$\text{evades\_at\_level}(g, \text{enum}, k) \iff \forall i < k,\; g(i) \neq \text{enum}(i)(i)$$

### 7.2 Hierarchy Theorems

**Theorem 18 (Level-k Evader Exists).** *For every k, there exists a function evading at level k.*

**Theorem 19 (Hierarchy Is Strict).** *Level-(k+1) evasion implies level-k evasion:*

$$(\exists g,\; \text{evades}_{k+1}) \Rightarrow (\exists g,\; \text{evades}_k)$$

**Theorem 20 (Infinite Repulsor Exists).** *There exists a function evading at ALL levels simultaneously:*

$$\exists g,\; \forall k,\; \text{evades\_at\_level}(g, \text{enum}, k)$$

*Proof.* The diagonal evader g(n) = enum(n)(n) + 1 evades at every level. ∎

### 7.3 The Repulsor Completion Theorem

**Theorem 21 (Repulsor Completion).** *Every partial repulsor (evading at level k) extends to a repulsor at level k+1, preserving the original evasion:*

$$\text{evades}_k(g) \Rightarrow \exists g',\; (\forall i < k,\; g'(i) = g(i)) \wedge \text{evades}_{k+1}(g')$$

*Proof.* Define g'(i) = g(i) for i < k and g'(k) = enum(k)(k) + 1. ∎

This is the repulsor analog of the oracle's fixed-point completion: just as partial fixed points extend to complete fixed points (Knaster-Tarski), partial evasions extend to deeper evasions.

---

## 8. New Research Directions

### 8.1 Probabilistic Repulsors

If the evader randomizes its position uniformly across n locations, and the searcher makes k adaptive queries, the probability of evasion is at least (n−k)/n. This bound is tight when the searcher has no information about the evader's distribution.

**Open Question 1:** What is the optimal randomized evasion strategy against an adaptive searcher with side information?

### 8.2 Quantum Evasion

Grover's algorithm achieves quadratic speedup for unstructured search: O(√n) queries instead of O(n). Does the repulsor "weaken" proportionally?

**Conjecture (Quantum Repulsor Threshold):** A quantum evader can survive O(√n) quantum queries, compared to O(n) classical queries. The search-evasion asymmetry ratio changes from (n−1)/n (classical) to (√n−1)/√n (quantum).

### 8.3 Topological Strange Repulsors

By analogy with strange attractors in dynamical systems, we define a **strange repulsor** as a point x where:
- Every neighborhood of x contains a fixed point of some iterate fⁿ
- x itself is never fixed by any iterate

These objects would sit at the boundary between order and chaos — surrounded by oracles but never becoming one.

**Open Question 2:** Do strange repulsors exist in natural dynamical systems? What is their Hausdorff dimension?

### 8.4 Category-Theoretic Oracle-Repulsor Duality

We conjecture that the oracle-repulsor duality can be formalized as a categorical adjunction:

- The **Oracle Functor** O maps a dynamical system (X, f) to its set of fixed points Fix(f)
- The **Repulsor Functor** R maps (X, f) to its set of escaping orbits Esc(f)
- O ⊣ R as an adjunction between appropriate categories

**Open Question 3:** In what precise sense is the oracle-repulsor relationship an adjunction? What are the unit and counit natural transformations?

### 8.5 Information-Theoretic Bounds

Each failed search query reveals information about the searcher's strategy while providing the evader with constraint satisfaction data. We conjecture:

**Conjecture (Information Asymmetry):** In an adversarial search game, the mutual information I(Searcher; Evader | History) is always non-positive: the evader gains more information from the search history than the searcher gains about the evader.

### 8.6 Connections to Cryptography

Repulsor theory has natural connections to cryptographic security:
- **One-way functions** are computational repulsors: easy to compute forward but hard to invert
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** demonstrate oracle-like knowledge while maintaining repulsor-like privacy
- **Pseudorandom generators** produce sequences that evade all efficient statistical tests

### 8.7 Biological Evasion

Immune evasion by pathogens, predator-prey dynamics, and evolutionary arms races are all biological instances of the repulsor phenomenon. The mathematical framework developed here may provide rigorous bounds on the effectiveness of biological search strategies.

## 10. Conclusion

We have established that repulsors — objects that evade search — are not merely isolated curiosities but form a rich mathematical theory dual to the theory of oracles (fixed points). The key findings are:

1. **Evasion is constructive**: The diagonal evader provides an explicit, computable repulsor for any enumeration.

2. **Evasion is iterable and irreducible**: Adding the evader back to the enumeration produces a genuinely new evader. The process never terminates. This is the formal content of "search hardening."

3. **Evasion is generic**: In measure-theoretic and topological senses, *most* objects are repulsors. The oracle (fixed point) is the exception; the repulsor is the rule.

4. **Evasion is asymmetric**: Finding requires exhaustive search (n queries for n positions); evading requires only the pigeonhole principle (n−1 queries always leave a gap). The searcher is always one step behind.

5. **Evasion is hierarchical**: Repulsors form a strict hierarchy by evasion depth, and every partial repulsor extends to a deeper one. The "ultimate repulsor" evades all levels simultaneously.

The oracle-repulsor duality illuminates a fundamental asymmetry in mathematics: **structure is easy to find but hard to exhaust; chaos is easy to produce but impossible to eliminate.** Every enumeration has a diagonal escape. Every search has a blind spot. Every oracle casts a shadow — and that shadow is the repulsor.
