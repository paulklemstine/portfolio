# The Photon Decoder: Composition Algebras and the Algebraic Structure of Light

## A Formally Verified Exploration in Lean 4

---

## Abstract

We explore a speculative but mathematically rigorous framework connecting photon momentum vectors to the classification of composition algebras via Hurwitz's theorem. Starting from the observation that Pythagorean triples — the integer points on the light cone — form an algebraic structure under Gaussian integer multiplication, we build a formally verified theory (in Lean 4 with Mathlib) encompassing the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity, helicity bounds, parity invariants, stereographic projection, and the n-square identities for n = 1, 2, 4, 8. We propose that these four composition algebras constitute the complete set of "algebraic channels" available to a photon, and investigate what physical properties each channel might encode.

## 1. Introduction: The Light Cone as an Algebraic Object

### 1.1 Pythagorean Triples and Photon Momenta

A massless particle (photon) in 2+1 dimensions satisfies the relativistic dispersion relation:

$$p_x^2 + p_y^2 = E^2$$

When restricted to integer momenta, this is exactly the Pythagorean relation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. The set of integer solutions — Pythagorean triples — thus parametrizes the "lattice photon states."

### 1.2 The Hurwitz Constraint

Hurwitz's theorem (1898) states that a "sum of n squares" composition identity

$$(x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2)(y_1^2 + \cdots + y_n^2) = z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2$$

(where each $z_k$ is bilinear in the $x_i$ and $y_j$) exists if and only if $n \in \{1, 2, 4, 8\}$. These correspond to the four normed division algebras: the reals $\mathbb{R}$, the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$, and the octonions $\mathbb{O}$.

**Central Thesis**: If photon algebra is governed by composition identities, then a photon has exactly four algebraic "channels" — no more, no less. Each channel corresponds to a distinct physical property.

---

## 2. The Four Channels: Formally Verified

### 2.1 Channel 1: The Real Numbers (n = 1) — Magnitude

The trivial identity $a^2 \cdot b^2 = (ab)^2$ encodes the **scalar/magnitude** channel.

**Physical interpretation**: Energy, frequency, or amplitude. This is the "how much" of a photon — its intensity. The real line is ordered, giving a natural notion of "more" or "less" energy.

**Formally verified** (`StereographicDecoder.lean`):
```lean
theorem one_square_identity (a b : ℤ) : a^2 * b^2 = (a * b)^2
```

**What is lost in the next doubling**: The Cayley-Dickson construction $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ sacrifices the total ordering of the reals. Complex numbers cannot be ordered — you cannot say one photon direction is "greater than" another.

### 2.2 Channel 2: The Complex Numbers (n = 2) — Direction

The Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity:

$$(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2$$

This is the norm-multiplicativity of Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, where $(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$.

**Physical interpretation**: **Direction of travel** (momentum direction). The argument $\theta = \arctan(b/a)$ of the Gaussian integer $a + bi$ gives the photon's propagation direction. The complex channel is the "which way" of the photon.

**Formally verified** (`BrahmaguptaFibonacci.lean`):
```lean
theorem brahmagupta_fibonacci (a b c d : ℤ) :
    (a^2 + b^2) * (c^2 + d^2) = (a*c - b*d)^2 + (a*d + b*c)^2

theorem gaussian_norm_multiplicative (z w : GaussianInt) :
    Zsqrtd.norm (z * w) = Zsqrtd.norm z * Zsqrtd.norm w
```

**Key discovery**: This identity IS the law of "photon fusion" — when two photons combine, their energies multiply and their directions compose via complex multiplication.

### 2.3 Channel 3: The Quaternions (n = 4) — Rotation/Polarization

Euler's four-square identity:

$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2 + b_4^2) = c_1^2 + c_2^2 + c_3^2 + c_4^2$$

where the $c_k$ are the components of the quaternion product.

**Physical interpretation**: **Polarization / rotation**. Unit quaternions form the group $SU(2)$, which double-covers $SO(3)$ (the rotation group). The Poincaré sphere of polarization states is precisely the space of unit quaternions modulo phase. Polarization — linear, circular, elliptical — is the "how it spins" of the photon.

**Formally verified** (`StereographicDecoder.lean`, `QuantumGates.lean`):
```lean
theorem four_square_identity (a₁ a₂ a₃ a₄ b₁ b₂ b₃ b₄ : ℤ) :
    (a₁^2 + a₂^2 + a₃^2 + a₄^2) * (b₁^2 + b₂^2 + b₃^2 + b₄^2) = ...

theorem quaternion_norm_sq_mul (q v : Quaternion ℝ) :
    Quaternion.normSq (q * v) = Quaternion.normSq q * Quaternion.normSq v
```

**What is lost**: The Cayley-Dickson construction $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{H}$ sacrifices commutativity. This is physically meaningful: the order of polarization rotations matters (rotating then phase-shifting ≠ phase-shifting then rotating).

### 2.4 Channel 4: The Octonions (n = 8) — The Unknown Channel

Degen's eight-square identity: the product of two sums of eight squares is again a sum of eight squares.

**Formally verified** (`StereographicDecoder.lean`):
```lean
theorem eight_square_identity (a₁ a₂ a₃ a₄ a₅ a₆ a₇ a₈ b₁ b₂ b₃ b₄ b₅ b₆ b₇ b₈ : ℤ) :
    (a₁^2 + a₂^2 + ... + a₈^2) * (b₁^2 + ... + b₈^2) = (c₁^2 + ... + c₈^2)
```

**What is lost**: The Cayley-Dickson construction $\mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{O}$ sacrifices associativity. This is the deepest algebraic constraint: $(xy)z \neq x(yz)$ in general.

**Physical interpretation — our hypothesis**: The octonionic channel encodes **quantum contextuality** — the property that the outcome of a measurement depends on what other measurements are performed alongside it. This is precisely the physical manifestation of non-associativity: the result of "measure A, then measure B, then measure C" depends on the grouping.

### 2.5 There Is No Fifth Channel

Hurwitz's theorem guarantees there is no 16-square identity. The Cayley-Dickson doubling $\mathbb{O} \to \mathbb{S}$ (sedenions, dimension 16) produces zero divisors — elements $a, b \neq 0$ with $ab = 0$. The composition property is irrecoverably lost.

**Physical prediction**: Any claimed "new photon property" must decompose into these four channels. There is no independent fifth degree of freedom.

---

## 3. The Photon Monoid

### 3.1 Gaussian Product = Photon Fusion

We define a `PhotonState` as a Pythagorean triple $(p_x, p_y, E)$ with $p_x^2 + p_y^2 = E^2$ and $E > 0$, and the "fusion" operation via the Gaussian integer product:

$$(p_1, p_2, E_1) \star (q_1, q_2, E_2) = (p_1 q_1 - p_2 q_2, \; p_1 q_2 + p_2 q_1, \; E_1 E_2)$$

**Formally verified properties** (`LightCone.lean`):

| Property | Statement | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Closure | Fusion of photons is a photon | ✅ Proved |
| Commutativity | $p \star q = q \star p$ | ✅ Proved |
| Associativity | $(p \star q) \star r = p \star (q \star r)$ | ✅ Proved |
| Identity | $(1, 0, 1) \star p = p$ | ✅ Proved |

**Note**: The identity element is $(1, 0, 1)$, the photon traveling purely in the x-direction with unit energy. This was initially incorrectly stated as $(0, 1, 1)$ and was caught by the formal verification (the theorem prover found a counterexample).

### 3.2 Physical Interpretation

The Gaussian product $(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$ corresponds to:
- **Energy multiplication**: $E_1 \cdot E_2$ (energies compose multiplicatively)
- **Angle addition**: $\theta_1 + \theta_2$ (directions compose additively, since $\arg(zw) = \arg(z) + \arg(w)$)

This is exactly what happens in nonlinear optical processes like four-wave mixing, where photons combine to produce new photons whose momenta and energies are related by conservation laws.

## 4. Helicity Bound

### 4.1 The AM-GM Constraint

For any Pythagorean triple $(a, b, c)$ with $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$:

$$2|ab| \leq c^2$$

equivalently: $|ab|/c^2 \leq 1/2$.

**Formally verified** (`HelicityBound.lean`):
```lean
theorem helicity_bound (a b c : ℤ) (h : a^2 + b^2 = c^2) :
    2 * |a * b| ≤ c^2

theorem helicity_bound_tight (a : ℤ) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
    2 * |a * a| = a^2 + a^2
```

### 4.2 Physical Interpretation

The ratio $|ab|/c^2$ is maximized when $a = b$ (the 45° direction), giving the "most helical" photon. This ratio measures how much of the photon's energy is distributed between the two transverse directions — a discrete analogue of the classical helicity.

---

## 5. Photon Parity: A Discrete Invariant

### 5.1 Parity Structure of Primitive Triples

For a primitive Pythagorean triple $(a, b, c)$ with $\gcd(a, b) = 1$:
- Exactly one of $a, b$ is even (the other is odd)
- $c$ is always odd

**Formally verified** (`PhotonParity.lean`):
```lean
theorem pyth_not_both_odd (a b c : ℤ) (h : a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
    (ha : ¬ 2 ∣ a) (hb : ¬ 2 ∣ b) : False

theorem pyth_hypotenuse_odd (a b c : ℕ) (h : a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
    (hcop : Nat.Coprime a b) : ¬ 2 ∣ c

theorem pyth_one_leg_even (a b c : ℕ) (h : a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
    (hcop : Nat.Coprime a b) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
    (2 ∣ a ∧ ¬ 2 ∣ b) ∨ (¬ 2 ∣ a ∧ 2 ∣ b)
```

### 5.2 Physical Interpretation

The even/odd assignment is a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-valued invariant of the primitive photon — a "discrete polarization." In the parametrization $a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$, the even leg is always $b = 2mn$, making this invariant canonical.

---

## 6. Stereographic Projection: The Decoder

### 6.1 From Sphere to Integers

The inverse stereographic projection maps a real number $t$ to a point on the unit circle:

$$t \mapsto \left(\frac{t^2 - 1}{t^2 + 1}, \; \frac{2t}{t^2 + 1}\right)$$

**Formally verified** (`StereographicDecoder.lean`):
```lean
theorem inv_stereo_on_circle (t : ℝ) :
    let p := inv_stereo_proj t
    p.1^2 + p.2^2 = 1
```

When $t = p/q$ is rational, clearing denominators yields the Pythagorean triple $(p^2 - q^2, 2pq, p^2 + q^2)$:

```lean
theorem rational_stereo_gives_pyth (p q : ℤ) (hq : q ≠ 0) (hp : (p : ℚ) / q ≠ 0) :
    (p^2 - q^2)^2 + (2*p*q)^2 = (p^2 + q^2)^2
```

### 6.2 The Four-Level Decoder

The stereographic projection works in each dimension:

| Dimension | Source | Target | Algebraic Structure | Physical Content |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | $S^0 = \{±1\}$ | $\mathbb{R}$ | Real line | Magnitude (energy/frequency) |
| 2 | $S^1$ (circle) | $\mathbb{C}$ | Gaussian integers | Direction of propagation |
| 4 | $S^3$ (3-sphere) | $\mathbb{H}$ | Lipschitz integers | Polarization state |
| 8 | $S^7$ (7-sphere) | $\mathbb{O}$ | Octavian integers | Contextuality / entanglement? |

Each level "decodes" a photon property by projecting from a sphere to its corresponding division algebra, then restricting to the integer lattice.

## 7. Quantum Gates and Photon Interference

### 7.1 Gate Sets from Composition Algebras

Each composition algebra provides a natural set of "gates" — transformations that preserve the photon structure:

- **Real gates** ($n=1$): Phase flips $x \mapsto \pm x$. Just 2 gates (the group $\{±1\}$).
- **Complex gates** ($n=2$): Multiplication by units of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Exactly 4 gates: $\{1, -1, i, -i\}$.
- **Quaternionic gates** ($n=4$): Unit quaternion conjugation $v \mapsto qvq^*$. Continuous group $SU(2)$.
- **Octonionic gates** ($n=8$): Automorphisms of $\mathbb{O}$. The exceptional Lie group $G_2$.

**Formally verified** (`QuantumGates.lean`):
```lean
theorem phase_gate_involutive (s : Bool) (x : ℤ) :
    phase_gate s (phase_gate s x) = x

theorem gaussian_unit_norm (u : GaussianInt) (hu : u ∈ gaussian_units) :
    Zsqrtd.norm u = 1
```

### 7.2 Light Interference as Algebraic Composition

When light interferes with itself (e.g., in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer), the mathematical operation is:
- **Constructive interference**: Addition in the underlying algebra
- **Beam splitting**: Multiplication by a unit (gate operation)
- **Photon fusion**: Gaussian product (composition of momenta)

The Hurwitz constraint implies that these operations form a closed algebra only in dimensions 1, 2, 4, 8. Any photonic quantum computer must operate within these four "native gate sets."

## 8. Light Cone Geometry

### 8.1 Triangulation from Light Cones

The intersection of two light cones determines position — this is the mathematical basis of GPS and all time-of-flight measurements.

**Formally verified** (`LightCone.lean`):
```lean
theorem light_cone_triangulation (x₁ x₂ r₁ r₂ x y : ℝ)
    (h1 : (x - x₁)^2 + y^2 = r₁^2)
    (h2 : (x - x₂)^2 + y^2 = r₂^2)
    (hne : x₁ ≠ x₂) :
    x = (r₁^2 - r₂^2 + x₂^2 - x₁^2) / (2 * (x₂ - x₁))
```

This connects the algebraic structure of photons directly to spacetime geometry.

## 9. The Octonionic Mystery: What Does Channel 4 Encode?

### 9.1 Candidates

Several physical properties have been proposed for the octonionic channel:

1. **Quantum contextuality / non-associativity of measurements**: The non-associativity of octonions mirrors the fact that sequential quantum measurements don't compose simply. The outcome of measuring A, then B, then C depends on the grouping — exactly as $(xy)z \neq x(yz)$ in the octonions.

2. **The Standard Model gauge structure**: The automorphism group of the octonions is the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, which contains $SU(3)$ as a subgroup. This $SU(3)$ is the gauge group of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The decomposition $\mathbb{O} = \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3$ under $SU(3)$ separates the "leptonic" direction from the "quark" directions.

3. **Triality and three generations**: The group $\operatorname{Spin}(8)$ has a remarkable $S_3$ outer automorphism (triality) that permutes three 8-dimensional representations. This has been speculatively connected to the three generations of fermions in the Standard Model.

4. **Entanglement structure**: The 8-dimensional space may encode the entanglement properties of multi-photon systems, with the non-associativity reflecting the monogamy of entanglement.

### 9.2 Our Assessment

The most compelling candidate is **(1) quantum contextuality**, because:
- It is a property of single photons (not multi-particle)
- It is intrinsically non-classical (no hidden-variable model)
- Its mathematical structure (non-associativity of operator products) directly mirrors the octonions
- The Kochen–Specker theorem, which establishes contextuality, relies on constructions in dimensions ≥ 3, which is consistent with octonions being the "third doubling" beyond the reals

However, **(2) the Standard Model connection** is also tantalizing and not mutually exclusive — the octonionic channel may encode multiple physical features simultaneously, just as the quaternionic channel encodes both polarization and angular momentum.

## 10. Summary of Formal Verification

All theorems in this paper have been formally verified in Lean 4 with Mathlib. The complete proof consists of **6 files** with **0 remaining sorries**:

| File | Theorems | Topic |
|------|----------|-------|
| `BrahmaguptaFibonacci.lean` | 4 | Two-square identity, Gaussian norm |
| `HelicityBound.lean` | 4 | AM-GM bound, helicity ratio |
| `PhotonParity.lean` | 4 | Parity of primitive triples |
| `StereographicDecoder.lean` | 6 | n-square identities (n=1,2,4,8), stereographic projection |
| `LightCone.lean` | 5 | Photon monoid, fusion, triangulation |
| `QuantumGates.lean` | 4 | Phase gates, Gaussian units, quaternion norms |

**Total: 27 formally verified theorems, 0 sorries.**

### Key Insights from Formal Verification

1. **The identity element bug**: The initial conjecture that $(0,1,1)$ is the identity photon under fusion was **disproved** by the theorem prover, which found a counterexample. The correct identity is $(1,0,1)$, corresponding to the Gaussian integer $1 + 0i = 1$. This illustrates the value of formal verification — the error is subtle and could easily persist in informal mathematics.

2. **The `on_cone` proof for fusion**: The fact that fusion preserves the light cone condition is equivalent to the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity. The theorem prover verified this via `linear_combination` from the two input `on_cone` hypotheses.

3. **The eight-square identity**: Despite having 8 input variables on each side (16 total), the theorem prover verified this identity. This is the octonionic composition law — the most complex algebraic identity that exists as a composition formula.

## 11. Open Questions and Future Directions

1. **Photon Factorization**: By unique factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, every photon state decomposes uniquely into "prime photons." Formalizing Fermat's two-square theorem as the classification of prime photon states would connect number theory to photon physics.

2. **Möbius Group on Photons**: Stereographic projection intertwines the Lorentz group with Möbius transformations on $\mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}$. Formalizing this would connect the photon monoid to special relativity.

3. **Asymptotic Counting**: The number of primitive photon states with energy $\leq N$ grows as $N / (2\pi)$. This connects to the Gauss circle problem and the density of lattice points on cones.

4. **Octonionic Experiments**: Design an experiment that tests whether single-photon measurements exhibit non-associative algebraic structure consistent with the octonionic channel.

5. **Quantum Computing**: Classify which quantum gates are "native" to each composition algebra channel, and determine whether the octonionic gates provide computational advantages over quaternionic (polarization) gates.

---

## 12. Conclusion

The Hurwitz theorem provides a rigid algebraic skeleton for the photon: exactly four composition algebras, exactly four channels. We have formally verified the mathematical infrastructure for this framework:

- **The real channel** ($n=1$): magnitude/energy ✅
- **The complex channel** ($n=2$): direction/momentum ✅
- **The quaternionic channel** ($n=4$): rotation/polarization ✅
- **The octonionic channel** ($n=8$): contextuality/??? — the frontier ✅

The formal verification caught a genuine error (the identity element), confirmed the complete algebraic structure (monoid, commutativity, associativity), and verified all four n-square identities including the 16-variable eight-square identity.

There is no fifth channel. The algebra of light is exactly four-dimensional — in the categorical sense, not the spatial sense. Whatever additional properties photons may have, they must be expressible within this four-fold structure.
